       "' CHAPTER I.\\n\\nTREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE\\n\\nCIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmong other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons\\n\\nit will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will\\n\\nassign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns,\\n\\ngreat or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on\\n\\na day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as\\n\\nit can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of\\n\\nthe business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is\\n\\nprefixed to the head of this chapter.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and\\n\\ntrouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable\\n\\ndoubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which\\n\\ncase it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never\\n\\nhave appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of\\n\\npages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the\\n\\nmost concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the\\n\\nliterature of any age or country.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a\\n\\nworkhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance\\n\\nthat can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this\\n\\nparticular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could\\n\\nby possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable\\n\\ndifficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of\\n\\nrespiration,—a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered\\n\\nnecessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a\\n\\nlittle flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and\\n\\nthe next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if,\\n\\nduring this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful\\n\\ngrandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of\\n\\nprofound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been\\n\\nkilled in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old\\n\\nwoman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;\\n\\nand a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and\\n\\nNature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a\\n\\nfew struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to\\n\\nthe inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been\\n\\nimposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could\\n\\nreasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been\\n\\npossessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer\\n\\nspace of time than three minutes and a quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his\\n\\nlungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron\\n\\nbedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly\\n\\nfrom the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,\\n\\n“Let me see the child, and die.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire:\\n\\ngiving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the\\n\\nyoung woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed’s head, said, with\\n\\nmore kindness than might have been expected of him:\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Lor bless her dear heart, no!” interposed the nurse, hastily\\n\\ndepositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which\\n\\nshe had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir,\\n\\nand had thirteen children of her own, and all on ’em dead except two,\\n\\nand them in the wurkus with me, she’ll know better than to take on in\\n\\nthat way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother,\\n\\nthere’s a dear young lamb do.”\\n\\n\\n\\nApparently this consolatory perspective of a mother’s prospects failed\\n\\nin producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched\\n\\nout her hand towards the child.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips\\n\\npassionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed\\n\\nwildly round; shuddered; fell back—and died. They chafed her breast,\\n\\nhands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of\\n\\nhope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!” said the surgeon at last.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah, poor dear, so it is!” said the nurse, picking up the cork of the\\n\\ngreen bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to\\n\\ntake up the child. “Poor dear!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You needn’t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,” said\\n\\nthe surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. “It’s very\\n\\nlikely it _will_ be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.” He\\n\\nput on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door,\\n\\nadded, “She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She was brought here last night,” replied the old woman, “by the\\n\\noverseer’s order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked\\n\\nsome distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came\\n\\nfrom, or where she was going to, nobody knows.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. “The old\\n\\nstory,” he said, shaking his head: “no wedding-ring, I see. Ah!\\n\\nGood-night!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once\\n\\nmore applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair\\n\\nbefore the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist\\n\\nwas! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only\\n\\ncovering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it\\n\\nwould have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him\\n\\nhis proper station in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old\\n\\ncalico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged\\n\\nand ticketed, and fell into his place at once—a parish child—the orphan\\n\\nof a workhouse—the humble, half-starved drudge—to be cuffed and\\n\\nbuffeted through the world—despised by all, and pitied by none.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan,\\n\\nleft to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he\\n\\nwould have cried the louder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CHAPTER II.\\n\\nTREATS OF OLIVER TWIST’S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic\\n\\ncourse of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The\\n\\nhungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported\\n\\nby the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish\\n\\nauthorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether\\n\\nthere was no female then domiciled in “the house” who was in a\\n\\nsituation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of\\n\\nwhich he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with\\n\\nhumility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities\\n\\nmagnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be “farmed,”\\n\\nor, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse\\n\\nsome three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders\\n\\nagainst the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the\\n\\ninconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental\\n\\nsuperintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and\\n\\nfor the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.\\n\\nSevenpence-halfpenny’s worth per week is a good round diet for a child;\\n\\na great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to\\n\\noverload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was\\n\\na woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children;\\n\\nand she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.\\n\\nSo, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own\\n\\nuse, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter\\n\\nallowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the\\n\\nlowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great\\n\\nexperimental philosopher.\\n\\n\\n\\nEverybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a\\n\\ngreat theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who\\n\\ndemonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw\\n\\na day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and\\n\\nrampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died,\\n\\nfour-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable\\n\\nbait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the\\n\\nfemale to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a\\n\\nsimilar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at\\n\\nthe very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest\\n\\npossible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen\\n\\nin eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want\\n\\nand cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by\\n\\naccident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was\\n\\nusually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers\\n\\nit had never known in this.\\n\\n\\n\\nOccasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest\\n\\nupon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead,\\n\\nor inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a\\n\\nwashing—though the latter accident was very scarce, anything\\n\\napproaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm—the jury\\n\\nwould take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the\\n\\nparishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a\\n\\nremonstrance. But these impertinences were speedily checked by the\\n\\nevidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of\\n\\nwhom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was\\n\\nvery probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever\\n\\nthe parish wanted; which was very self-devotional. Besides, the board\\n\\nmade periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the\\n\\nday before, to say they were going. The children were neat and clean to\\n\\nbehold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have!\\n\\n\\n\\nIt cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any\\n\\nvery extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist’s ninth birthday\\n\\nfound him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and\\n\\ndecidedly small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had\\n\\nimplanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver’s breast. It had had plenty of\\n\\nroom to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and\\n\\nperhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth\\n\\nbirth-day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth\\n\\nbirthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party\\n\\nof two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a\\n\\nsound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be\\n\\nhungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly\\n\\nstartled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo\\n\\nthe wicket of the garden-gate.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Goodness gracious! Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?” said Mrs. Mann,\\n\\nthrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.\\n\\n“(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash ’em\\n\\ndirectly.)—My heart alive! Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you,\\n\\nsure-ly!”\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of\\n\\nresponding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave\\n\\nthe little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick\\n\\nwhich could have emanated from no leg but a beadle’s.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Lor, only think,” said Mrs. Mann, running out,—for the three boys had\\n\\nbeen removed by this time,—“only think of that! That I should have\\n\\nforgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them\\n\\ndear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have\\n\\nsoftened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the\\n\\nbeadle.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,” inquired\\n\\nMr. Bumble, grasping his cane, “to keep the parish officers a waiting\\n\\nat your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with\\n\\nthe porochial orphans? Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may\\n\\nsay, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear\\n\\nchildren as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,” replied Mrs.\\n\\nMann with great humility.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his\\n\\nimportance. He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He\\n\\nrelaxed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, well, Mrs. Mann,” he replied in a calmer tone; “it may be as you\\n\\nsay; it may be. Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and\\n\\nhave something to say.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor;\\n\\nplaced a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and\\n\\ncane on the table before him. Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the\\n\\nperspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the\\n\\ncocked hat, and smiled. Yes, he smiled. Beadles are but men: and Mr.\\n\\nBumble smiled.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now don’t you be offended at what I’m a going to say,” observed Mrs.\\n\\nMann, with captivating sweetness. “You’ve had a long walk, you know, or\\n\\nI wouldn’t mention it. Now, will you take a little drop of somethink,\\n\\nMr. Bumble?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not a drop. Nor a drop,” said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a\\n\\ndignified, but placid manner.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think you will,” said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the\\n\\nrefusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. “Just a leetle drop,\\n\\nwith a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Bumble coughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, just a leetle drop,” said Mrs. Mann persuasively.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is it?” inquired the beadle.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, it’s what I’m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put\\n\\ninto the blessed infants’ Daffy, when they ain’t well, Mr. Bumble,”\\n\\nreplied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a\\n\\nbottle and glass. “It’s gin. I’ll not deceive you, Mr. B. It’s gin.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?” inquired Bumble, following\\n\\nwith his eyes the interesting process of mixing.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah, bless ’em, that I do, dear as it is,” replied the nurse. “I\\n\\ncouldn’t see ’em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No”; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; “no, you could not. You are a humane\\n\\nwoman, Mrs. Mann.” (Here she set down the glass.) “I shall take a early\\n\\nopportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.” (He drew it\\n\\ntowards him.) “You feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.” (He stirred the\\n\\ngin-and-water.) “I—I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann”;\\n\\nand he swallowed half of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And now about business,” said the beadle, taking out a leathern\\n\\npocket-book. “The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine\\n\\nyear old to-day.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Bless him!” interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the\\n\\ncorner of her apron.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was\\n\\nafterwards increased to twenty pound. Notwithstanding the most\\n\\nsuperlative, and, I may say, supernat’ral exertions on the part of this\\n\\nparish,” said Bumble, “we have never been able to discover who is his\\n\\nfather, or what was his mother’s settlement, name, or condition.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment’s\\n\\nreflection, “How comes he to have any name at all, then?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, “I inwented it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You, Mr. Bumble!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I, Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last\\n\\nwas a S,—Swubble, I named him. This was a T,—Twist, I named _him_. The\\n\\nnext one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins. I have got names\\n\\nready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it\\n\\nagain, when we come to Z.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, you’re quite a literary character, sir!” said Mrs. Mann.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, well,” said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment;\\n\\n“perhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.” He finished the\\n\\ngin-and-water, and added, “Oliver being now too old to remain here, the\\n\\nboard have determined to have him back into the house. I have come out\\n\\nmyself to take him there. So let me see him at once.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll fetch him directly,” said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that\\n\\npurpose. Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of\\n\\ndirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed\\n\\noff in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent\\n\\nprotectress.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,” said Mrs. Mann.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair,\\n\\nand the cocked hat on the table.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Will you go along with me, Oliver?” said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic\\n\\nvoice.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great\\n\\nreadiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had\\n\\ngot behind the beadle’s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a\\n\\nfurious countenance. He took the hint at once, for the fist had been\\n\\ntoo often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his\\n\\nrecollection.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Will she go with me?” inquired poor Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, she can’t,” replied Mr. Bumble. “But she’ll come and see you\\n\\nsometimes.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was no very great consolation to the child. Young as he was,\\n\\nhowever, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at\\n\\ngoing away. It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears\\n\\ninto his eyes. Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you\\n\\nwant to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed. Mrs. Mann gave him\\n\\na thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece\\n\\nof bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the\\n\\nworkhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little\\n\\nbrown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.\\n\\nBumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never\\n\\nlighted the gloom of his infant years. And yet he burst into an agony\\n\\nof childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him. Wretched as\\n\\nwere the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were\\n\\nthe only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in\\n\\nthe great wide world, sank into the child’s heart for the first time.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping\\n\\nhis gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every\\n\\nquarter of a mile whether they were “nearly there.” To these\\n\\ninterrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for\\n\\nthe temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had\\n\\nby this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an\\n\\nhour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of\\n\\nbread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old\\n\\nwoman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him\\n\\nthat the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.\\n\\n\\n\\nNot having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was,\\n\\nOliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite\\n\\ncertain whether he ought to laugh or cry. He had no time to think about\\n\\nthe matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with\\n\\nhis cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively:\\n\\nand bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed\\n\\nroom, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table. At\\n\\nthe top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the\\n\\nrest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Bow to the board,” said Bumble. Oliver brushed away two or three tears\\n\\nthat were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table,\\n\\nfortunately bowed to that.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s your name, boy?” said the gentleman in the high chair.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him\\n\\ntremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him\\n\\ncry. These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating\\n\\nvoice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool.\\n\\nWhich was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite\\n\\nat his ease.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Boy,” said the gentleman in the high chair, “listen to me. You know\\n\\nyou’re an orphan, I suppose?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s that, sir?” inquired poor Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The boy _is_ a fool—I thought he was,” said the gentleman in the white\\n\\nwaistcoat.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hush!” said the gentleman who had spoken first. “You know you’ve got\\n\\nno father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don’t\\n\\nyou?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What are you crying for?” inquired the gentleman in the white\\n\\nwaistcoat. And to be sure it was very extraordinary. What _could_ the\\n\\nboy be crying for?\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hope you say your prayers every night,” said another gentleman in a\\n\\ngruff voice; “and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of\\n\\nyou—like a Christian.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was\\n\\nunconsciously right. It would have been very like a Christian, and a\\n\\nmarvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people\\n\\nwho fed and took care of _him_. But he hadn’t, because nobody had\\n\\ntaught him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well! You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,”\\n\\nsaid the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So you’ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o’clock,” added\\n\\nthe surly one in the white waistcoat.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process\\n\\nof picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and\\n\\nwas then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he\\n\\nsobbed himself to sleep. What a novel illustration of the tender laws\\n\\nof England! They let the paupers go to sleep!\\n\\n\\n\\nPoor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy\\n\\nunconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day\\n\\narrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence\\n\\nover all his future fortunes. But they had. And this was it:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and\\n\\nwhen they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out\\n\\nat once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered—the poor\\n\\npeople liked it! It was a regular place of public entertainment for the\\n\\npoorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public\\n\\nbreakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and\\n\\nmortar elysium, where it was all play and no work. “Oho!” said the\\n\\nboard, looking very knowing; “we are the fellows to set this to rights;\\n\\nwe’ll stop it all, in no time.” So, they established the rule, that all\\n\\npoor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody,\\n\\nnot they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a\\n\\nquick one out of it. With this view, they contracted with the\\n\\nwater-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a\\n\\ncorn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and\\n\\nissued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and\\n\\nhalf a roll of Sundays. They made a great many other wise and humane\\n\\nregulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary\\n\\nto repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in\\n\\nconsequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors’ Commons; and,\\n\\ninstead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had\\n\\ntheretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a\\n\\nbachelor! There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under\\n\\nthese last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society,\\n\\nif it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were\\n\\nlong-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty. The relief was\\n\\ninseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened\\n\\npeople.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was\\n\\nin full operation. It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of\\n\\nthe increase in the undertaker’s bill, and the necessity of taking in\\n\\nthe clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their\\n\\nwasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two’s gruel. But the number of\\n\\nworkhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were\\n\\nin ecstasies.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a\\n\\ncopper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the\\n\\npurpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at\\n\\nmealtimes. Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and\\n\\nno more—except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two\\n\\nounces and a quarter of bread besides.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bowls never wanted washing. The boys polished them with their\\n\\nspoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this\\n\\noperation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large\\n\\nas the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager\\n\\neyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was\\n\\ncomposed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers\\n\\nmost assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of\\n\\ngruel that might have been cast thereon. Boys have generally excellent\\n\\nappetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of\\n\\nslow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and\\n\\nwild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn’t\\n\\nbeen used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small\\n\\ncook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another\\n\\nbasin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to\\n\\neat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of\\n\\ntender age. He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed\\n\\nhim. A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the\\n\\nmaster after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to\\n\\nOliver Twist.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe evening arrived; the boys took their places. The master, in his\\n\\ncook’s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants\\n\\nranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long\\n\\ngrace was said over the short commons. The gruel disappeared; the boys\\n\\nwhispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors\\n\\nnudged him. Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless\\n\\nwith misery. He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin\\n\\nand spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:\\n\\n\\n\\n“Please, sir, I want some more.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in\\n\\nstupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then\\n\\nclung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with\\n\\nwonder; the boys with fear.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What!” said the master at length, in a faint voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Please, sir,” replied Oliver, “I want some more.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe master aimed a blow at Oliver’s head with the ladle; pinioned him\\n\\nin his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into\\n\\nthe room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high\\n\\nchair, said,\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked for\\n\\nmore!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“For _more_!” said Mr. Limbkins. “Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer\\n\\nme distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had\\n\\neaten the supper allotted by the dietary?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He did, sir,” replied Bumble.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That boy will be hung,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. “I\\n\\nknow that boy will be hung.”\\n\\n\\n\\nNobody controverted the prophetic gentleman’s opinion. An animated\\n\\ndiscussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and\\n\\na bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a\\n\\nreward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the\\n\\nhands of the parish. In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were\\n\\noffered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade,\\n\\nbusiness, or calling.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I never was more convinced of anything in my life,” said the gentleman\\n\\nin the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill\\n\\nnext morning: “I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than\\n\\nI am that that boy will come to be hung.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated\\n\\ngentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this\\n\\nnarrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint\\n\\njust yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination\\n\\nor no.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CHAPTER III.\\n\\nRELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT\\n\\nHAVE BEEN A SINECURE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of\\n\\nasking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and\\n\\nsolitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of\\n\\nthe board. It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose,\\n\\nthat, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the\\n\\nprediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have\\n\\nestablished that sage individual’s prophetic character, once and for\\n\\never, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the\\n\\nwall, and attaching himself to the other. To the performance of this\\n\\nfeat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that\\n\\npocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for\\n\\nall future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the\\n\\nexpress order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and\\n\\npronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still greater\\n\\nobstacle in Oliver’s youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly all\\n\\nday; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands\\n\\nbefore his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner,\\n\\ntried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and\\n\\ndrawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its\\n\\ncold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which\\n\\nsurrounded him.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet it not be supposed by the enemies of “the system,” that, during the\\n\\nperiod of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of\\n\\nexercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious\\n\\nconsolation. As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was\\n\\nallowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a\\n\\nstone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching\\n\\ncold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated\\n\\napplications of the cane. As for society, he was carried every other\\n\\nday into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a\\n\\npublic warning and example. And so far from being denied the advantages\\n\\nof religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every\\n\\nevening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console\\n\\nhis mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special\\n\\nclause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they\\n\\nentreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be\\n\\nguarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication\\n\\ndistinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection\\n\\nof the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory\\n\\nof the very Devil himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt chanced one morning, while Oliver’s affairs were in this auspicious\\n\\nand comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way\\n\\ndown the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means\\n\\nof paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become\\n\\nrather pressing. Mr. Gamfield’s most sanguine estimate of his finances\\n\\ncould not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount;\\n\\nand, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately\\n\\ncudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his\\n\\neyes encountered the bill on the gate.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Wo—o!” said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably,\\n\\nwhether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when\\n\\nhe had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was\\n\\nladen; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but\\n\\nmore particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow\\n\\non his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a\\n\\ndonkey’s. Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp\\n\\nwrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and\\n\\nby these means turned him round. He then gave him another blow on the\\n\\nhead, just to stun him till he came back again. Having completed these\\n\\narrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with\\n\\nhis hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound\\n\\nsentiments in the board-room. Having witnessed the little dispute\\n\\nbetween Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that\\n\\nperson came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield\\n\\nwas exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield\\n\\nsmiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the\\n\\nsum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was\\n\\nencumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse\\n\\nwas, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing\\n\\nfor register stoves. So, he spelt the bill through again, from\\n\\nbeginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility,\\n\\naccosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to ’prentis,” said Mr.\\n\\nGamfield.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ay, my man,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a\\n\\ncondescending smile. “What of him?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a\\n\\ngood ’spectable chimbley-sweepin’ bisness,” said Mr. Gamfield, “I wants\\n\\na ’prentis, and I am ready to take him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Walk in,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield\\n\\nhaving lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head,\\n\\nand another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his\\n\\nabsence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room\\n\\nwhere Oliver had first seen him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s a nasty trade,” said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated\\n\\nhis wish.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,” said another\\n\\ngentleman.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley\\n\\nto make ’em come down again,” said Gamfield; “that’s all smoke, and no\\n\\nblaze; vereas smoke ain’t o’ no use at all in making a boy come down,\\n\\nfor it only sinds him to sleep, and that’s wot he likes. Boys is wery\\n\\nobstinit, and wery lazy, Gen’l’men, and there’s nothink like a good hot\\n\\nblaze to make ’em come down vith a run. It’s humane too, gen’l’men,\\n\\nacause, even if they’ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet\\n\\nmakes ’em struggle to hextricate theirselves.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this\\n\\nexplanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr.\\n\\nLimbkins. The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a\\n\\nfew minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words “saving of\\n\\nexpenditure,” “looked well in the accounts,” “have a printed report\\n\\npublished,” were alone audible. These only chanced to be heard, indeed,\\n\\nor account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having\\n\\nresumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:\\n\\n\\n\\n“We have considered your proposition, and we don’t approve of it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not at all,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Decidedly not,” added the other members.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of\\n\\nhaving bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him\\n\\nthat the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into\\n\\ntheir heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their\\n\\nproceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business,\\n\\nif they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the\\n\\nrumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the\\n\\ntable.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So you won’t let me have him, gen’l’men?” said Mr. Gamfield, pausing\\n\\nnear the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” replied Mr. Limbkins; “at least, as it’s a nasty business, we\\n\\nthink you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Gamfield’s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he\\n\\nreturned to the table, and said,\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’ll you give, gen’l’men? Come! Don’t be too hard on a poor man.\\n\\nWhat’ll you give?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I should say, three pound ten was plenty,” said Mr. Limbkins.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ten shillings too much,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come!” said Gamfield; “say four pound, gen’l’men. Say four pound, and\\n\\nyou’ve got rid of him for good and all. There!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Three pound ten,” repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come! I’ll split the diff’erence, gen’l’men,” urged Gamfield. “Three\\n\\npound fifteen.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not a farthing more,” was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re desperate hard upon me, gen’l’men,” said Gamfield, wavering.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pooh! pooh! nonsense!” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\\n\\n“He’d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly\\n\\nfellow! He’s just the boy for you. He wants the stick, now and then:\\n\\nit’ll do him good; and his board needn’t come very expensive, for he\\n\\nhasn’t been overfed since he was born. Ha! ha! ha!”\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and,\\n\\nobserving a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.\\n\\nThe bargain was made. Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver\\n\\nTwist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for\\n\\nsignature and approval, that very afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive\\n\\nastonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself\\n\\ninto a clean shirt. He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic\\n\\nperformance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin\\n\\nof gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of\\n\\nbread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously:\\n\\nthinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill\\n\\nhim for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten\\n\\nhim up in that way.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,”\\n\\nsaid Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. “You’re a going to\\n\\nbe made a ’prentice of, Oliver.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A prentice, sir!” said the child, trembling.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Oliver,” said Mr. Bumble. “The kind and blessed gentleman which\\n\\nis so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are\\n\\na going to “prentice” you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of\\n\\nyou: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!—three pound\\n\\nten, Oliver!—seventy shillins—one hundred and forty sixpences!—and all\\n\\nfor a naughty orphan which nobody can’t love.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in\\n\\nan awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child’s face, and he\\n\\nsobbed bitterly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come,” said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying\\n\\nto his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced;\\n\\n“Come, Oliver! Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don’t\\n\\ncry into your gruel; that’s a very foolish action, Oliver.” It\\n\\ncertainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all\\n\\nhe would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the\\n\\ngentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like\\n\\nit very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey:\\n\\nthe rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in\\n\\neither particular, there was no telling what would be done to him. When\\n\\nthey arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself,\\n\\nand admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour. At\\n\\nthe expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned\\n\\nwith the cocked hat, and said aloud:\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.” As Mr. Bumble said this,\\n\\nhe put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, “Mind\\n\\nwhat I told you, you young rascal!”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble’s face at this somewhat\\n\\ncontradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his\\n\\noffering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining\\n\\nroom: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great\\n\\nwindow. Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one\\n\\nof whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with\\n\\nthe aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of\\n\\nparchment which lay before him. Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of\\n\\nthe desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face,\\n\\non the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were\\n\\nlounging about.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the\\n\\nlittle bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had\\n\\nbeen stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is the boy, your worship,” said Mr. Bumble.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a\\n\\nmoment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon,\\n\\nthe last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, is this the boy?” said the old gentleman.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is him, sir,” replied Mr. Bumble. “Bow to the magistrate, my\\n\\ndear.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been\\n\\nwondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates’ powder, whether all\\n\\nboards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards\\n\\nfrom thenceforth on that account.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the old gentleman, “I suppose he’s fond of\\n\\nchimney-sweeping?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He doats on it, your worship,” replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly\\n\\npinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn’t.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And he _will_ be a sweep, will he?” inquired the old gentleman.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he’d run away\\n\\nsimultaneous, your worship,” replied Bumble.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And this man that’s to be his master—you, sir—you’ll treat him well,\\n\\nand feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?” said the old\\n\\ngentleman.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When I says I will, I means I will,” replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest,\\n\\nopen-hearted man,” said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in\\n\\nthe direction of the candidate for Oliver’s premium, whose villainous\\n\\ncountenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty. But the\\n\\nmagistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn’t reasonably\\n\\nbe expected to discern what other people did.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hope I am, sir,” said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have no doubt you are, my friend,” replied the old gentleman: fixing\\n\\nhis spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the\\n\\ninkstand.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the critical moment of Oliver’s fate. If the inkstand had been\\n\\nwhere the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen\\n\\ninto it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been\\n\\nstraightway hurried off. But, as it chanced to be immediately under his\\n\\nnose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his\\n\\ndesk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his\\n\\nsearch to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and\\n\\nterrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks\\n\\nand pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his\\n\\nfuture master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too\\n\\npalpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to\\n\\nMr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and\\n\\nunconcerned aspect.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My boy!” said the old gentleman, “you look pale and alarmed. What is\\n\\nthe matter?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Stand a little away from him, Beadle,” said the other magistrate:\\n\\nlaying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of\\n\\ninterest. “Now, boy, tell us what’s the matter: don’t be afraid.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that\\n\\nthey would order him back to the dark room—that they would starve\\n\\nhim—beat him—kill him if they pleased—rather than send him away with\\n\\nthat dreadful man.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well!” said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most\\n\\nimpressive solemnity. “Well! of all the artful and designing orphans\\n\\nthat ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hold your tongue, Beadle,” said the second old gentleman, when Mr.\\n\\nBumble had given vent to this compound adjective.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I beg your worship’s pardon,” said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having\\n\\nheard aright. “Did your worship speak to me?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. Hold your tongue.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold\\n\\nhis tongue! A moral revolution!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his\\n\\ncompanion, he nodded significantly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We refuse to sanction these indentures,” said the old gentleman:\\n\\ntossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hope,” stammered Mr. Limbkins: “I hope the magistrates will not form\\n\\nthe opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper\\n\\nconduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the\\n\\nmatter,” said the second old gentleman sharply. “Take the boy back to\\n\\nthe workhouse, and treat him kindly. He seems to want it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThat same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively\\n\\nand decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he\\n\\nwould be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his\\n\\nhead with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good;\\n\\nwhereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him;\\n\\nwhich, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem\\n\\nto be a wish of a totally opposite description.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was\\n\\nagain To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would\\n\\ntake possession of him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CHAPTER IV.\\n\\nOLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC\\n\\nLIFE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained,\\n\\neither in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the\\n\\nyoung man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to\\n\\nsea. The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took\\n\\ncounsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in\\n\\nsome small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port. This\\n\\nsuggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done\\n\\nwith him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to\\n\\ndeath, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his\\n\\nbrains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty\\n\\ngenerally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman\\n\\nof that class. The more the case presented itself to the board, in this\\n\\npoint of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared;\\n\\nso, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for\\n\\nOliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries,\\n\\nwith the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a\\n\\ncabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to\\n\\ncommunicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate,\\n\\nno less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit\\n\\nof threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour,\\n\\nand shoes to answer. His features were not naturally intended to wear a\\n\\nsmiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional\\n\\njocosity. His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward\\n\\npleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by\\n\\nthe hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr.\\n\\nBumble,” said the undertaker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,” said the beadle, as he\\n\\nthrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the\\n\\nundertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. “I\\n\\nsay you’ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,” repeated Mr. Bumble,\\n\\ntapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his\\n\\ncane.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Think so?” said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half\\n\\ndisputed the probability of the event. “The prices allowed by the board\\n\\nare very small, Mr. Bumble.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“So are the coffins,” replied the beadle: with precisely as near an\\n\\napproach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be;\\n\\nand laughed a long time without cessation. “Well, well, Mr. Bumble,” he\\n\\nsaid at length, “there’s no denying that, since the new system of\\n\\nfeeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more\\n\\nshallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble.\\n\\nWell-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron\\n\\nhandles come, by canal, from Birmingham.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, well,” said Mr. Bumble, “every trade has its drawbacks. A fair\\n\\nprofit is, of course, allowable.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course, of course,” replied the undertaker; “and if I don’t get a\\n\\nprofit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the\\n\\nlong-run, you see—he! he! he!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just so,” said Mr. Bumble.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Though I must say,” continued the undertaker, resuming the current of\\n\\nobservations which the beadle had interrupted: “though I must say, Mr.\\n\\nBumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage:\\n\\nwhich is, that all the stout people go off the quickest. The people who\\n\\nhave been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first\\n\\nto sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble,\\n\\nthat three or four inches over one’s calculation makes a great hole in\\n\\none’s profits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an\\n\\nill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a\\n\\nreflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it\\n\\nadvisable to change the subject. Oliver Twist being uppermost in his\\n\\nmind, he made him his theme.\\n\\n\\n\\n“By the bye,” said Mr. Bumble, “you don’t know anybody who wants a boy,\\n\\ndo you? A porochial ’prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a\\n\\nmillstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat? Liberal terms, Mr.\\n\\nSowerberry, liberal terms?” As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to\\n\\nthe bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words “five\\n\\npounds”: which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Gadso!” said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged\\n\\nlappel of his official coat; “that’s just the very thing I wanted to\\n\\nspeak to you about. You know—dear me, what a very elegant button this\\n\\nis, Mr. Bumble! I never noticed it before.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I think it rather pretty,” said the beadle, glancing proudly\\n\\ndownwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. “The\\n\\ndie is the same as the porochial seal—the Good Samaritan healing the\\n\\nsick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear’s\\n\\nmorning, Mr. Sowerberry. I put it on, I remember, for the first time,\\n\\nto attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway\\n\\nat midnight.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I recollect,” said the undertaker. “The jury brought it in, ‘Died from\\n\\nexposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,’\\n\\ndidn’t they?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Bumble nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And they made it a special verdict, I think,” said the undertaker, “by\\n\\nadding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had—”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Tush! Foolery!” interposed the beadle. “If the board attended to all\\n\\nthe nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they’d have enough to do.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very true,” said the undertaker; “they would indeed.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Juries,” said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont\\n\\nwhen working into a passion: “juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling\\n\\nwretches.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“So they are,” said the undertaker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They haven’t no more philosophy nor political economy about ’em than\\n\\nthat,” said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No more they have,” acquiesced the undertaker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I despise ’em,” said the beadle, growing very red in the face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So do I,” rejoined the undertaker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And I only wish we’d a jury of the independent sort, in the house for\\n\\na week or two,” said the beadle; “the rules and regulations of the\\n\\nboard would soon bring their spirit down for ’em.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let ’em alone for that,” replied the undertaker. So saying, he smiled,\\n\\napprovingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the\\n\\ninside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his\\n\\nrage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the\\n\\nundertaker, said in a calmer voice:\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well; what about the boy?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh!” replied the undertaker; “why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good\\n\\ndeal towards the poor’s rates.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hem!” said Mr. Bumble. “Well?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” replied the undertaker, “I was thinking that if I pay so much\\n\\ntowards ’em, I’ve a right to get as much out of ’em as I can, Mr.\\n\\nBumble; and so—I think I’ll take the boy myself.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the\\n\\nbuilding. Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes;\\n\\nand it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening “upon\\n\\nliking”—a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that\\n\\nif the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out\\n\\nof a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for\\n\\na term of years, to do what he likes with.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen little Oliver was taken before “the gentlemen” that evening; and\\n\\ninformed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a\\n\\ncoffin-maker’s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever\\n\\ncame back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be\\n\\ndrowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so\\n\\nlittle emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened\\n\\nyoung rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the\\n\\nworld, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror\\n\\nat the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they\\n\\nwere rather out, in this particular instance. The simple fact was, that\\n\\nOliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too\\n\\nmuch; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of\\n\\nbrutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received. He\\n\\nheard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had\\n\\nhis luggage put into his hand—which was not very difficult to carry,\\n\\ninasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper\\n\\nparcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep—he pulled his cap\\n\\nover his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble’s coat\\n\\ncuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark;\\n\\nfor the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should:\\n\\nand, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by\\n\\nthe skirts of Mr. Bumble’s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to\\n\\ngreat advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches. As\\n\\nthey drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it\\n\\nexpedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for\\n\\ninspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and\\n\\nbecoming air of gracious patronage.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oliver!” said Mr. Bumble.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of\\n\\nhis unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them\\n\\nwhen he looked up at his conductor. As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon\\n\\nhim, it rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another, and another.\\n\\nThe child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one.\\n\\nWithdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble’s he covered his face with\\n\\nboth; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and\\n\\nbony fingers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little\\n\\ncharge a look of intense malignity. “Well! Of _all_ the ungratefullest,\\n\\nand worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the—”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, no, sir,” sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the\\n\\nwell-known cane; “no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I\\n\\nwill, sir! I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so—so—”\\n\\n\\n\\n“So what?” inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So lonely, sir! So very lonely!” cried the child. “Everybody hates me.\\n\\nOh! sir, don’t, don’t pray be cross to me!” The child beat his hand\\n\\nupon his heart; and looked in his companion’s face, with tears of real\\n\\nagony.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Bumble regarded Oliver’s piteous and helpless look, with some\\n\\nastonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky\\n\\nmanner; and after muttering something about “that troublesome cough,”\\n\\nbade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his\\n\\nhand, he walked on with him in silence.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was\\n\\nmaking some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate\\n\\ndismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Aha!” said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in\\n\\nthe middle of a word; “is that you, Bumble?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,” replied the beadle. “Here! I’ve brought\\n\\nthe boy.” Oliver made a bow.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! that’s the boy, is it?” said the undertaker: raising the candle\\n\\nabove his head, to get a better view of Oliver. “Mrs. Sowerberry, will\\n\\nyou have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and\\n\\npresented the form of a short, thin, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish\\n\\ncountenance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear,” said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, “this is the boy from\\n\\nthe workhouse that I told you of.” Oliver bowed again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dear me!” said the undertaker’s wife, “he’s very small.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, he _is_ rather small,” replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as\\n\\nif it were his fault that he was no bigger; “he is small. There’s no\\n\\ndenying it. But he’ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry—he’ll grow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! I dare say he will,” replied the lady pettishly, “on our victuals\\n\\nand our drink. I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they\\n\\nalways cost more to keep, than they’re worth. However, men always think\\n\\nthey know best. There! Get downstairs, little bag o’ bones.” With this,\\n\\nthe undertaker’s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a\\n\\nsteep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the\\n\\nante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated “kitchen”; wherein sat a\\n\\nslatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very\\n\\nmuch out of repair.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Here, Charlotte,” said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down,\\n\\n“give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. He\\n\\nhasn’t come home since the morning, so he may go without ’em. I dare\\n\\nsay the boy isn’t too dainty to eat ’em—are you, boy?”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was\\n\\ntrembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a\\n\\nplateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.\\n\\n\\n\\nI wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall\\n\\nwithin him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen\\n\\nOliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.\\n\\nI wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver\\n\\ntore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine. There is only\\n\\none thing I should like better; and that would be to see the\\n\\nPhilosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the undertaker’s wife, when Oliver had finished his\\n\\nsupper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful\\n\\nauguries of his future appetite: “have you done?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the\\n\\naffirmative.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then come with me,” said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty\\n\\nlamp, and leading the way upstairs; “your bed’s under the counter. You\\n\\ndon’t mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn’t much\\n\\nmatter whether you do or don’t, for you can’t sleep anywhere else.\\n\\nCome; don’t keep me here all night!”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CHAPTER V.\\n\\nOLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST\\n\\nTIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER’S BUSINESS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver, being left to himself in the undertaker’s shop, set the lamp\\n\\ndown on a workman’s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling\\n\\nof awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be\\n\\nat no loss to understand. An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which\\n\\nstood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a\\n\\ncold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the\\n\\ndirection of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see\\n\\nsome frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror.\\n\\nAgainst the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm\\n\\nboards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like\\n\\nhigh-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.\\n\\nCoffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black\\n\\ncloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was\\n\\nornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff\\n\\nneckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by\\n\\nfour black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and\\n\\nhot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. The\\n\\nrecess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust,\\n\\nlooked like a grave.\\n\\n\\n\\nNor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was\\n\\nalone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the\\n\\nbest of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no\\n\\nfriends to care for, or to care for him. The regret of no recent\\n\\nseparation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and\\n\\nwell-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept\\n\\ninto his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be\\n\\nlain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the\\n\\ntall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep\\n\\nbell to soothe him in his sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of\\n\\nthe shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was\\n\\nrepeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.\\n\\nWhen he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Open the door, will yer?” cried the voice which belonged to the legs\\n\\nwhich had kicked at the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will, directly, sir,” replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning\\n\\nthe key.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I suppose yer the new boy, ain’t yer?” said the voice through the\\n\\nkey-hole.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How old are yer?” inquired the voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ten, sir,” replied Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then I’ll whop yer when I get in,” said the voice; “you just see if I\\n\\ndon’t, that’s all, my work’us brat!” and having made this obliging\\n\\npromise, the voice began to whistle.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very\\n\\nexpressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the\\n\\nsmallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would\\n\\nredeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a\\n\\ntrembling hand, and opened the door.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street,\\n\\nand over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had\\n\\naddressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm\\n\\nhimself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post\\n\\nin front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut\\n\\ninto wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then\\n\\nconsumed with great dexterity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Oliver at length: seeing that no other\\n\\nvisitor made his appearance; “did you knock?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I kicked,” replied the charity-boy.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did you want a coffin, sir?” inquired Oliver, innocently.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver\\n\\nwould want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that\\n\\nway.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yer don’t know who I am, I suppose, Work’us?” said the charity-boy, in\\n\\ncontinuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with\\n\\nedifying gravity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, sir,” rejoined Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m Mister Noah Claypole,” said the charity-boy, “and you’re under me.\\n\\nTake down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!” With this, Mr.\\n\\nClaypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a\\n\\ndignified air, which did him great credit. It is difficult for a\\n\\nlarge-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy\\n\\ncountenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more\\n\\nespecially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red\\n\\nnose and yellow smalls.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in\\n\\nhis effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a\\n\\nsmall court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the\\n\\nday, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the\\n\\nassurance that “he’d catch it,” condescended to help him. Mr.\\n\\nSowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry\\n\\nappeared. Oliver having “caught it,” in fulfilment of Noah’s\\n\\nprediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come near the fire, Noah,” said Charlotte. “I saved a nice little bit\\n\\nof bacon for you from master’s breakfast. Oliver, shut that door at\\n\\nMister Noah’s back, and take them bits that I’ve put out on the cover\\n\\nof the bread-pan. There’s your tea; take it away to that box, and drink\\n\\nit there, and make haste, for they’ll want you to mind the shop. D’ye\\n\\nhear?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“D’ye hear, Work’us?” said Noah Claypole.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Lor, Noah!” said Charlotte, “what a rum creature you are! Why don’t\\n\\nyou let the boy alone?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let him alone!” said Noah. “Why everybody lets him alone enough, for\\n\\nthe matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever\\n\\ninterfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty\\n\\nwell. Eh, Charlotte? He! he! he!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you queer soul!” said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in\\n\\nwhich she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully\\n\\nat poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest\\n\\ncorner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially\\n\\nreserved for him.\\n\\n\\n\\nNoah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan. No chance-child was\\n\\nhe, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents,\\n\\nwho lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a\\n\\ndrunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of\\n\\ntwopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction. The shop-boys in the\\n\\nneighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public\\n\\nstreets, with the ignominious epithets of “leathers,” “charity,” and\\n\\nthe like; and Noah had bourne them without reply. But, now that fortune\\n\\nhad cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could\\n\\npoint the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. This\\n\\naffords charming food for contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful\\n\\nthing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same\\n\\namiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest\\n\\ncharity-boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver had been sojourning at the undertaker’s some three weeks or a\\n\\nmonth. Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry—the shop being shut up—were taking their\\n\\nsupper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several\\n\\ndeferential glances at his wife, said,\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear—” He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up,\\n\\nwith a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing, my dear, nothing,” said Mr. Sowerberry.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ugh, you brute!” said Mrs. Sowerberry.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not at all, my dear,” said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. “I thought you\\n\\ndidn’t want to hear, my dear. I was only going to say—”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, don’t tell me what you were going to say,” interposed Mrs.\\n\\nSowerberry. “I am nobody; don’t consult me, pray. _I_ don’t want to\\n\\nintrude upon your secrets.” As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an\\n\\nhysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But, my dear,” said Sowerberry, “I want to ask your advice.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, no, don’t ask mine,” replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting\\n\\nmanner: “ask somebody else’s.” Here, there was another hysterical\\n\\nlaugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. This is a very common\\n\\nand much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very\\n\\neffective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special\\n\\nfavour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to\\n\\nhear. After a short duration, the permission was most graciously\\n\\nconceded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s only about young Twist, my dear,” said Mr. Sowerberry. “A very\\n\\ngood-looking boy, that, my dear.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He need be, for he eats enough,” observed the lady.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,” resumed Mr.\\n\\nSowerberry, “which is very interesting. He would make a delightful\\n\\nmute, my love.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable\\n\\nwonderment. Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for\\n\\nany observation on the good lady’s part, proceeded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but\\n\\nonly for children’s practice. It would be very new to have a mute in\\n\\nproportion, my dear. You may depend upon it, it would have a superb\\n\\neffect.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way,\\n\\nwas much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been\\n\\ncompromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances,\\n\\nshe merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious\\n\\nsuggestion had not presented itself to her husband’s mind before? Mr.\\n\\nSowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his\\n\\nproposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should\\n\\nbe at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this\\n\\nview, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of\\n\\nhis services being required.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe occasion was not long in coming. Half an hour after breakfast next\\n\\nmorning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against\\n\\nthe counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he\\n\\nselected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Aha!” said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance;\\n\\n“an order for a coffin, eh?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,” replied Mr.\\n\\nBumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like\\n\\nhimself, was very corpulent.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Bayton,” said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.\\n\\nBumble. “I never heard the name before.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBumble shook his head, as he replied, “Obstinate people, Mr.\\n\\nSowerberry; very obstinate. Proud, too, I’m afraid, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Proud, eh?” exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. “Come, that’s too\\n\\nmuch.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, it’s sickening,” replied the beadle. “Antimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“So it is,” acquiesced the undertaker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We only heard of the family the night before last,” said the beadle;\\n\\n“and we shouldn’t have known anything about them, then, only a woman\\n\\nwho lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial\\n\\ncommittee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was\\n\\nvery bad. He had gone out to dinner; but his ’prentice (which is a very\\n\\nclever lad) sent ’em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah, there’s promptness,” said the undertaker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Promptness, indeed!” replied the beadle. “But what’s the consequence;\\n\\nwhat’s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Why, the husband\\n\\nsends back word that the medicine won’t suit his wife’s complaint, and\\n\\nso she shan’t take it—says she shan’t take it, sir! Good, strong,\\n\\nwholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish\\n\\nlabourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before—sent ’em for nothing,\\n\\nwith a blackin’-bottle in,—and he sends back word that she shan’t take\\n\\nit, sir!”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble’s mind in full force, he\\n\\nstruck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with\\n\\nindignation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the undertaker, “I ne—ver—did—”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Never did, sir!” ejaculated the beadle. “No, nor nobody never did; but\\n\\nnow she’s dead, we’ve got to bury her; and that’s the direction; and\\n\\nthe sooner it’s done, the better.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a\\n\\nfever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!”\\n\\nsaid Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the\\n\\nstreet.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of\\n\\nsight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at\\n\\nthe mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble’s voice.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe needn’t haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble’s glance,\\n\\nhowever; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman\\n\\nin the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that\\n\\nnow the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better\\n\\navoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years,\\n\\nand all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish\\n\\nshould be thus effectually and legally overcome.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, “the sooner this job is\\n\\ndone, the better. Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your cap,\\n\\nand come with me.” Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his\\n\\nprofessional mission.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely\\n\\ninhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street\\n\\nmore dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused\\n\\nto look for the house which was the object of their search. The houses\\n\\non either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by\\n\\npeople of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have\\n\\nsufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the\\n\\nsqualid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies\\n\\nhalf doubled, occasionally skulked along. A great many of the tenements\\n\\nhad shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only\\n\\nthe upper rooms being inhabited. Some houses which had become insecure\\n\\nfrom age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by\\n\\nhuge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the\\n\\nroad; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the\\n\\nnightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards\\n\\nwhich supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their\\n\\npositions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human\\n\\nbody. The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The very rats, which here and\\n\\nthere lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver\\n\\nand his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark\\n\\npassage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the\\n\\nundertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs. Stumbling\\n\\nagainst a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. The undertaker\\n\\nat once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the\\n\\napartment to which he had been directed. He stepped in; Oliver followed\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically,\\n\\nover the empty stove. An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the\\n\\ncold hearth, and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged\\n\\nchildren in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door,\\n\\nthere lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket.\\n\\nOliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept\\n\\ninvoluntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the\\n\\nboy felt that it was a corpse.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man’s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly;\\n\\nhis eyes were bloodshot. The old woman’s face was wrinkled; her two\\n\\nremaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright\\n\\nand piercing. Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. They\\n\\nseemed so like the rats he had seen outside.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nobody shall go near her,” said the man, starting fiercely up, as the\\n\\nundertaker approached the recess. “Keep back! Damn you, keep back, if\\n\\nyou’ve a life to lose!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense, my good man,” said the undertaker, who was pretty well used\\n\\nto misery in all its shapes. “Nonsense!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I tell you,” said the man: clenching his hands, and stamping furiously\\n\\non the floor,—“I tell you I won’t have her put into the ground. She\\n\\ncouldn’t rest there. The worms would worry her—not eat her—she is so\\n\\nworn away.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape\\n\\nfrom his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at\\n\\nthe feet of the dead woman; “kneel down, kneel down—kneel round her,\\n\\nevery one of you, and mark my words! I say she was starved to death. I\\n\\nnever knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her\\n\\nbones were starting through the skin. There was neither fire nor\\n\\ncandle; she died in the dark—in the dark! She couldn’t even see her\\n\\nchildren’s faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged\\n\\nfor her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back,\\n\\nshe was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they\\n\\nstarved her to death. I swear it before the God that saw it! They\\n\\nstarved her!” He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud scream,\\n\\nrolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam covering\\n\\nhis lips.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had\\n\\nhitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that\\n\\npassed, menaced them into silence. Having unloosened the cravat of the\\n\\nman who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the\\n\\nundertaker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She was my daughter,” said the old woman, nodding her head in the\\n\\ndirection of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more\\n\\nghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. “Lord, Lord!\\n\\nWell, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman\\n\\nthen, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and\\n\\nstiff! Lord, Lord!—to think of it; it’s as good as a play—as good as a\\n\\nplay!”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment,\\n\\nthe undertaker turned to go away.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Stop, stop!” said the old woman in a loud whisper. “Will she be buried\\n\\nto-morrow, or next day, or to-night? I laid her out; and I must walk,\\n\\nyou know. Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter\\n\\ncold. We should have cake and wine, too, before we go! Never mind; send\\n\\nsome bread—only a loaf of bread and a cup of water. Shall we have some\\n\\nbread, dear?” she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker’s coat, as\\n\\nhe once more moved towards the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, yes,” said the undertaker,”of course. Anything you like!” He\\n\\ndisengaged himself from the old woman’s grasp; and, drawing Oliver\\n\\nafter him, hurried away.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a\\n\\nhalf-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble\\n\\nhimself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where\\n\\nMr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the\\n\\nworkhouse, who were to act as bearers. An old black cloak had been\\n\\nthrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin\\n\\nhaving been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers,\\n\\nand carried into the street.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!” whispered\\n\\nSowerberry in the old woman’s ear; “we are rather late; and it won’t\\n\\ndo, to keep the clergyman waiting. Move on, my men,—as quick as you\\n\\nlike!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the\\n\\ntwo mourners kept as near them, as they could. Mr. Bumble and\\n\\nSowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs\\n\\nwere not so long as his master’s, ran by the side.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had\\n\\nanticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the\\n\\nchurchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were\\n\\nmade, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by\\n\\nthe vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it\\n\\nmight be an hour or so, before he came. So, they put the bier on the\\n\\nbrink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp\\n\\nclay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the\\n\\nspectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at\\n\\nhide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by\\n\\njumping backwards and forwards over the coffin. Mr. Sowerberry and\\n\\nBumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him,\\n\\nand read the paper.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble,\\n\\nand Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.\\n\\nImmediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice\\n\\nas he came along. Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up\\n\\nappearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the\\n\\nburial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his\\n\\nsurplice to the clerk, and walked away again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, Bill!” said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. “Fill up!”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the\\n\\nuppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface. The grave-digger\\n\\nshovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet:\\n\\nshouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who\\n\\nmurmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come, my good fellow!” said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. “They\\n\\nwant to shut up the yard.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the\\n\\ngrave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had\\n\\naddressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a\\n\\nswoon. The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss\\n\\nof her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any\\n\\nattention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came\\n\\nto, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed\\n\\non their different ways.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, Oliver,” said Sowerberry, as they walked home, “how do you like\\n\\nit?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pretty well, thank you, sir” replied Oliver, with considerable\\n\\nhesitation. “Not very much, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah, you’ll get used to it in time, Oliver,” said Sowerberry. “Nothing\\n\\nwhen you _are_ used to it, my boy.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time\\n\\nto get Mr. Sowerberry used to it. But he thought it better not to ask\\n\\nthe question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had\\n\\nseen and heard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CHAPTER VI.\\n\\nOLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND\\n\\nRATHER ASTONISHES HIM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe month’s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed. It was a nice\\n\\nsickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase, coffins were\\n\\nlooking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great\\n\\ndeal of experience. The success of Mr. Sowerberry’s ingenious\\n\\nspeculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes. The oldest\\n\\ninhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so\\n\\nprevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful\\n\\nprocessions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to\\n\\nhis knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the\\n\\nmothers in the town. As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his\\n\\nadult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity\\n\\nof demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a\\n\\nfinished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the\\n\\nbeautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded\\n\\npeople bear their trials and losses.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich\\n\\nold lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews\\n\\nand nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous\\n\\nillness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most\\n\\npublic occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need\\n\\nbe—quite cheerful and contented—conversing together with as much\\n\\nfreedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb\\n\\nthem. Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic\\n\\ncalmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far\\n\\nfrom grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to\\n\\nrender it as becoming and attractive as possible. It was observable,\\n\\ntoo, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during\\n\\nthe ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached\\n\\nhome, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over. All\\n\\nthis was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with\\n\\ngreat admiration.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good\\n\\npeople, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm\\n\\nwith any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for\\n\\nmany months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and\\n\\nill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now\\n\\nthat his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the\\n\\nblack stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in\\n\\nthe muffin-cap and leathers. Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah\\n\\ndid; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry\\n\\nwas disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and\\n\\na glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as\\n\\ncomfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in\\n\\nthe grain department of a brewery.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver’s history; for I\\n\\nhave to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance,\\n\\nbut which indirectly produced a material change in all his future\\n\\nprospects and proceedings.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual\\n\\ndinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton—a pound and a half\\n\\nof the worst end of the neck—when Charlotte being called out of the\\n\\nway, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being\\n\\nhungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a\\n\\nworthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.\\n\\n\\n\\nIntent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the\\n\\ntable-cloth; and pulled Oliver’s hair; and twitched his ears; and\\n\\nexpressed his opinion that he was a “sneak”; and furthermore announced\\n\\nhis intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable\\n\\nevent should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty\\n\\nannoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was.\\n\\nBut, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and\\n\\nin his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want\\n\\nto be funny. He got rather personal.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Work’us,” said Noah, “how’s your mother?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She’s dead,” replied Oliver; “don’t you say anything about her to me!”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver’s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there\\n\\nwas a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole\\n\\nthought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.\\n\\nUnder this impression he returned to the charge.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What did she die of, Work’us?” said Noah.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,” replied Oliver:\\n\\nmore as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. “I think I\\n\\nknow what it must be to die of that!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work’us,” said Noah, as a tear\\n\\nrolled down Oliver’s cheek. “What’s set you a snivelling now?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not _you_,” replied Oliver, sharply. “There; that’s enough. Don’t say\\n\\nanything more to me about her; you’d better not!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Better not!” exclaimed Noah. “Well! Better not! Work’us, don’t be\\n\\nimpudent. _Your_ mother, too! She was a nice ’un she was. Oh, Lor!” And\\n\\nhere, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his\\n\\nsmall red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the\\n\\noccasion.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yer know, Work’us,” continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver’s silence,\\n\\nand speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most\\n\\nannoying: “Yer know, Work’us, it can’t be helped now; and of course yer\\n\\ncouldn’t help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I’m sure we all\\n\\nare, and pity yer very much. But yer must know, Work’us, yer mother was\\n\\na regular right-down bad ’un.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What did you say?” inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A regular right-down bad ’un, Work’us,” replied Noah, coolly. “And\\n\\nit’s a great deal better, Work’us, that she died when she did, or else\\n\\nshe’d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung;\\n\\nwhich is more likely than either, isn’t it?”\\n\\n\\n\\nCrimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table;\\n\\nseized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till\\n\\nhis teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into\\n\\none heavy blow, felled him to the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nA minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected\\n\\ncreature that harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused\\n\\nat last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire.\\n\\nHis breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid;\\n\\nhis whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly\\n\\ntormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an\\n\\nenergy he had never known before.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He’ll murder me!” blubbered Noah. “Charlotte! missis! Here’s the new\\n\\nboy a murdering of me! Help! help! Oliver’s gone mad! Char—lotte!”\\n\\n\\n\\nNoah’s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a\\n\\nlouder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen\\n\\nby a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was\\n\\nquite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human\\n\\nlife, to come further down.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you little wretch!” screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her\\n\\nutmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man\\n\\nin particularly good training. “Oh, you little un-grate-ful,\\n\\nmur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!” And between every syllable, Charlotte\\n\\ngave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream,\\n\\nfor the benefit of society.\\n\\n\\n\\nCharlotte’s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not\\n\\nbe effectual in calming Oliver’s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into\\n\\nthe kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she\\n\\nscratched his face with the other. In this favourable position of\\n\\naffairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all\\n\\nwearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver,\\n\\nstruggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and\\n\\nthere locked him up. This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a\\n\\nchair, and burst into tears.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Bless her, she’s going off!” said Charlotte. “A glass of water, Noah,\\n\\ndear. Make haste!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! Charlotte,” said Mrs. Sowerberry: speaking as well as she could,\\n\\nthrough a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which\\n\\nNoah had poured over her head and shoulders. “Oh! Charlotte, what a\\n\\nmercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! mercy indeed, ma’am,” was the reply. I only hope this’ll teach\\n\\nmaster not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born\\n\\nto be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah! He was\\n\\nall but killed, ma’am, when I come in.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Poor fellow!” said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the\\n\\ncharity-boy.\\n\\n\\n\\nNoah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level\\n\\nwith the crown of Oliver’s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his\\n\\nwrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed\\n\\nsome affecting tears and sniffs.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s to be done!” exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. “Your master’s not at\\n\\nhome; there’s not a man in the house, and he’ll kick that door down in\\n\\nten minutes.” Oliver’s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in\\n\\nquestion, rendered this occurance highly probable.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dear, dear! I don’t know, ma’am,” said Charlotte, “unless we send for\\n\\nthe police-officers.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Or the millingtary,” suggested Mr. Claypole.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, no,” said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver’s old\\n\\nfriend. “Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly,\\n\\nand not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste! You can hold\\n\\na knife to that black eye, as you run along. It’ll keep the swelling\\n\\ndown.”\\n\\n\\n\\nNoah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed;\\n\\nand very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a\\n\\ncharity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his\\n\\nhead, and a clasp-knife at his eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CHAPTER VII.\\n\\nOLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNoah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused\\n\\nnot once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested\\n\\nhere, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an\\n\\nimposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and\\n\\npresented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that\\n\\neven he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of\\n\\ntimes, started back in astonishment.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, what’s the matter with the boy!” said the old pauper.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!” cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in\\n\\ntones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr.\\n\\nBumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much\\n\\nthat he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,—which is a very\\n\\ncurious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle,\\n\\nacted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a\\n\\nmomentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of\\n\\npersonal dignity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!” said Noah: “Oliver, sir,—Oliver has—”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What? What?” interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his\\n\\nmetallic eyes. “Not run away; he hasn’t run away, has he, Noah?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, sir, no. Not run away, sir, but he’s turned wicious,” replied\\n\\nNoah. “He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder\\n\\nCharlotte; and then missis. Oh! what dreadful pain it is! Such agony,\\n\\nplease, sir!” And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an\\n\\nextensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to\\n\\nunderstand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist,\\n\\nhe had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was\\n\\nat that moment suffering the acutest torture.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed\\n\\nMr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his\\n\\ndreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a\\n\\ngentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in\\n\\nhis lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to\\n\\nattract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman\\n\\naforesaid.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gentleman’s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked\\n\\nthree paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young\\n\\ncur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with\\n\\nsomething which would render the series of vocular exclamations so\\n\\ndesignated, an involuntary process?\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,” replied Mr. Bumble, “who\\n\\nhas been nearly murdered—all but murdered, sir,—by young Twist.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“By Jove!” exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping\\n\\nshort. “I knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first,\\n\\nthat that audacious young savage would come to be hung!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,” said\\n\\nMr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And his missis,” interposed Mr. Claypole.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?” added Mr. Bumble.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No! he’s out, or he would have murdered him,” replied Noah. “He said\\n\\nhe wanted to.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?” inquired the gentleman in the\\n\\nwhite waistcoat.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” replied Noah. “And please, sir, missis wants to know\\n\\nwhether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog\\n\\nhim—’cause master’s out.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly, my boy; certainly,” said the gentleman in the white\\n\\nwaistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah’s head, which was about\\n\\nthree inches higher than his own. “You’re a good boy—a very good boy.\\n\\nHere’s a penny for you. Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry’s with your\\n\\ncane, and see what’s best to be done. Don’t spare him, Bumble.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, I will not, sir,” replied the beadle. And the cocked hat and cane\\n\\nhaving been, by this time, adjusted to their owner’s satisfaction, Mr.\\n\\nBumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the\\n\\nundertaker’s shop.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere the position of affairs had not at all improved. Sowerberry had\\n\\nnot yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished\\n\\nvigour, at the cellar-door. The accounts of his ferocity as related by\\n\\nMrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr.\\n\\nBumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door. With this\\n\\nview he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then,\\n\\napplying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oliver!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come; you let me out!” replied Oliver, from the inside.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you know this here voice, Oliver?” said Mr. Bumble.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ain’t you afraid of it, sir? Ain’t you a-trembling while I speak,\\n\\nsir?” said Mr. Bumble.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No!” replied Oliver, boldly.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was\\n\\nin the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little. He\\n\\nstepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and\\n\\nlooked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute\\n\\nastonishment.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,” said Mrs. Sowerberry.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s not Madness, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of\\n\\ndeep meditation. “It’s Meat.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What?” exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Meat, ma’am, meat,” replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. “You’ve\\n\\nover-fed him, ma’am. You’ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him,\\n\\nma’am unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs.\\n\\nSowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you. What have\\n\\npaupers to do with soul or spirit? It’s quite enough that we let ’em\\n\\nhave live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma’am, this would\\n\\nnever have happened.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dear, dear!” ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to\\n\\nthe kitchen ceiling: “this comes of being liberal!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse\\n\\nbestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else\\n\\nwould eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in\\n\\nher voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble’s heavy accusation. Of\\n\\nwhich, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or\\n\\ndeed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth\\n\\nagain; “the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to\\n\\nleave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he’s a little starved\\n\\ndown; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the\\n\\napprenticeship. He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs.\\n\\nSowerberry! Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his\\n\\nmade her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed\\n\\nany well-disposed woman, weeks before.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this point of Mr. Bumble’s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to\\n\\nknow that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced\\n\\nkicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.\\n\\nSowerberry returned at this juncture. Oliver’s offence having been\\n\\nexplained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best\\n\\ncalculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a\\n\\ntwinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver’s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face\\n\\nwas bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead.\\n\\nThe angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled\\n\\nout of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite\\n\\nundismayed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain’t you?” said Sowerberry; giving\\n\\nOliver a shake, and a box on the ear.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He called my mother names,” replied Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?” said Mrs.\\n\\nSowerberry. “She deserved what he said, and worse.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She didn’t” said Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She did,” said Mrs. Sowerberry.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s a lie!” said Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. If he had\\n\\nhesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be\\n\\nquite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been,\\n\\naccording to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a\\n\\nbrute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of\\n\\na man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital\\n\\nwithin the limits of this chapter. To do him justice, he was, as far as\\n\\nhis power went—it was not very extensive—kindly disposed towards the\\n\\nboy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because\\n\\nhis wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no\\n\\nresource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.\\n\\nSowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble’s subsequent application of\\n\\nthe parochial cane, rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day, he was\\n\\nshut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of\\n\\nbread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks\\n\\noutside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his\\n\\nmother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of\\n\\nNoah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the\\n\\ngloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings\\n\\nwhich the day’s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a\\n\\nmere child. He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he\\n\\nhad borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in\\n\\nhis heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they\\n\\nhad roasted him alive. But now, when there were none to see or hear\\n\\nhim, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his\\n\\nhands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few\\n\\nso young may ever have cause to pour out before him!\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The\\n\\ncandle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having\\n\\ngazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the\\n\\nfastenings of the door, and looked abroad.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a cold, dark night. The stars seemed, to the boy’s eyes, farther\\n\\nfrom the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind;\\n\\nand the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked\\n\\nsepulchral and death-like, from being so still. He softly reclosed the\\n\\ndoor. Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie\\n\\nup in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat\\n\\nhimself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the\\n\\nshutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look\\n\\naround—one moment’s pause of hesitation—he had closed it behind him,\\n\\nand was in the open street.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up\\n\\nthe hill. He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the\\n\\nfields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the\\n\\nroad; struck into it, and walked quickly on.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlong this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside\\n\\nMr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.\\n\\nHis way lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly\\n\\nwhen he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back.\\n\\nHe had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by\\n\\ndoing so. Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of\\n\\nhis being seen; so he walked on.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring\\n\\nat that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden. A child\\n\\nwas weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale\\n\\nface and disclosed the features of one of his former companions. Oliver\\n\\nfelt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself,\\n\\nhe had been his little friend and playmate. They had been beaten, and\\n\\nstarved, and shut up together, many and many a time.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hush, Dick!” said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his\\n\\nthin arm between the rails to greet him. “Is any one up?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nobody but me,” replied the child.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You musn’t say you saw me, Dick,” said Oliver. “I am running away.\\n\\nThey beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some\\n\\nlong way off. I don’t know where. How pale you are!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,” replied the child with a\\n\\nfaint smile. “I am very glad to see you, dear; but don’t stop, don’t\\n\\nstop!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b’ye to you,” replied Oliver. “I shall\\n\\nsee you again, Dick. I know I shall! You will be well and happy!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hope so,” replied the child. “After I am dead, but not before. I\\n\\nknow the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of\\n\\nHeaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.\\n\\nKiss me,” said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his\\n\\nlittle arms round Oliver’s neck. “Good-b’ye, dear! God bless you!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe blessing was from a young child’s lips, but it was the first that\\n\\nOliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles\\n\\nand sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never\\n\\nonce forgot it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nOLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF\\n\\nYOUNG GENTLEMAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more\\n\\ngained the high-road. It was eight o’clock now. Though he was nearly\\n\\nfive miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by\\n\\nturns, till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken. Then\\n\\nhe sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think,\\n\\nfor the first time, where he had better go and try to live.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an\\n\\nintimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The\\n\\nname awakened a new train of ideas in the boy’s mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nLondon!—that great place!—nobody—not even Mr. Bumble—could ever find\\n\\nhim there! He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say\\n\\nthat no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of\\n\\nliving in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country\\n\\nparts had no idea of. It was the very place for a homeless boy, who\\n\\nmust die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these things\\n\\npassed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked\\n\\nforward.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four\\n\\nmiles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could\\n\\nhope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced\\n\\nitself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his\\n\\nmeans of getting there. He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and\\n\\ntwo pairs of stockings, in his bundle. He had a penny too—a gift of\\n\\nSowerberry’s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more\\n\\nthan ordinarily well—in his pocket. “A clean shirt,” thought Oliver,\\n\\n“is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings;\\n\\nand so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles’ walk\\n\\nin winter time.” But Oliver’s thoughts, like those of most other\\n\\npeople, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his\\n\\ndifficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of\\n\\nsurmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular\\n\\npurpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and\\n\\ntrudged on.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing\\n\\nbut the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he\\n\\nbegged at the cottage-doors by the road-side. When the night came, he\\n\\nturned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined\\n\\nto lie there, till morning. He felt frightened at first, for the wind\\n\\nmoaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and\\n\\nmore alone than he had ever felt before. Being very tired with his\\n\\nwalk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that\\n\\nhe was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very\\n\\nfirst village through which he passed. He had walked no more than\\n\\ntwelve miles, when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his\\n\\nlegs so weak that they trembled beneath him. Another night passed in\\n\\nthe bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey\\n\\nnext morning he could hardly crawl along.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and\\n\\nthen begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took\\n\\nany notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the\\n\\ntop of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a\\n\\nhalfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way,\\n\\nbut was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet. When\\n\\nthe outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets\\n\\nagain, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn’t deserve\\n\\nanything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust\\n\\nbehind.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all\\n\\npersons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to\\n\\njail. This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of\\n\\nthose villages with all possible expedition. In others, he would stand\\n\\nabout the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a\\n\\nproceeding which generally terminated in the landlady’s ordering one of\\n\\nthe post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of\\n\\nthe place, for she was sure he had come to steal something. If he\\n\\nbegged at a farmer’s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the\\n\\ndog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about\\n\\nthe beadle—which brought Oliver’s heart into his mouth,—very often the\\n\\nonly thing he had there, for many hours together.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a\\n\\nbenevolent old lady, Oliver’s troubles would have been shortened by the\\n\\nvery same process which had put an end to his mother’s; in other words,\\n\\nhe would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king’s highway. But\\n\\nthe turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady,\\n\\nwho had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part\\n\\nof the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little\\n\\nshe could afford—and more—with such kind and gentle words, and such\\n\\ntears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver’s\\n\\nsoul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver\\n\\nlimped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were\\n\\nclosed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business\\n\\nof the day. The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the\\n\\nlight only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation,\\n\\nas he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up;\\n\\nand people began passing to and fro. Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver\\n\\nfor a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried\\n\\nby; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he\\n\\ncame there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great\\n\\nnumber of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern,\\n\\nlarge or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed\\n\\nthrough, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with\\n\\nease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and\\n\\ndetermination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by\\n\\nobserving that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes\\n\\nbefore, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the\\n\\nopposite side of the way. He took little heed of this at first; but the\\n\\nboy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that\\n\\nOliver raised his head, and returned his steady look. Upon this, the\\n\\nboy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hullo, my covey! What’s the row?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his\\n\\nown age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even\\n\\nseen. He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and as\\n\\ndirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the\\n\\nairs and manners of a man. He was short of his age: with rather\\n\\nbow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of\\n\\nhis head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment—and\\n\\nwould have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of\\n\\nevery now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it\\n\\nback to its old place again. He wore a man’s coat, which reached nearly\\n\\nto his heels. He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his arm, to get\\n\\nhis hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of\\n\\nthrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he\\n\\nkept them. He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young\\n\\ngentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the\\n\\nbluchers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hullo, my covey! What’s the row?” said this strange young gentleman to\\n\\nOliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am very hungry and tired,” replied Oliver: the tears standing in his\\n\\neyes as he spoke. “I have walked a long way. I have been walking these\\n\\nseven days.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Walking for sivin days!” said the young gentleman. “Oh, I see. Beak’s\\n\\norder, eh? But,” he added, noticing Oliver’s look of surprise, “I\\n\\nsuppose you don’t know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird’s mouth\\n\\ndescribed by the term in question.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My eyes, how green!” exclaimed the young gentleman. “Why, a beak’s a\\n\\nmadgst’rate; and when you walk by a beak’s order, it’s not straight\\n\\nforerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin. Was you\\n\\nnever on the mill?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What mill?” inquired Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What mill! Why, _the_ mill—the mill as takes up so little room that\\n\\nit’ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind’s\\n\\nlow with people, than when it’s high; acos then they can’t get workmen.\\n\\nBut come,” said the young gentleman; “you want grub, and you shall have\\n\\nit. I’m at low-water-mark myself—only one bob and a magpie; but, as far\\n\\nas it goes, I’ll fork out and stump. Up with you on your pins. There!\\n\\nNow then! “Morrice!”\\n\\n\\n\\nAssisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent\\n\\nchandler’s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham\\n\\nand a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, “a fourpenny\\n\\nbran!” the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the\\n\\ningenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a\\n\\nportion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein. Taking the bread under\\n\\nhis arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led\\n\\nthe way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer\\n\\nwas brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver,\\n\\nfalling to, at his new friend’s bidding, made a long and hearty meal,\\n\\nduring the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time\\n\\nwith great attention.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Going to London?” said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length\\n\\nconcluded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Got any lodgings?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Money?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as\\n\\nthe big coat-sleeves would let them go.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you live in London?” inquired Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. I do, when I’m at home,” replied the boy. “I suppose you want\\n\\nsome place to sleep in to-night, don’t you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do, indeed,” answered Oliver. “I have not slept under a roof since I\\n\\nleft the country.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t fret your eyelids on that score,” said the young gentleman.\\n\\n“I’ve got to be in London to-night; and I know a ’spectable old\\n\\ngentleman as lives there, wot’ll give you lodgings for nothink, and\\n\\nnever ask for the change—that is, if any genelman he knows interduces\\n\\nyou. And don’t he know me? Oh, no! Not in the least! By no means.\\n\\nCertainly not!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments\\n\\nof discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did\\n\\nso.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted;\\n\\nespecially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the\\n\\nold gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a\\n\\ncomfortable place, without loss of time. This led to a more friendly\\n\\nand confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his\\n\\nfriend’s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and\\n\\nprotege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Dawkin’s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the\\n\\ncomforts which his patron’s interest obtained for those whom he took\\n\\nunder his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute\\n\\nmode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate\\n\\nfriends he was better known by the sobriquet of “The Artful Dodger,”\\n\\nOliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the\\n\\nmoral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon\\n\\nhim. Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good\\n\\nopinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found\\n\\nthe Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to\\n\\ndecline the honour of his farther acquaintance.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it\\n\\nwas nearly eleven o’clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington.\\n\\nThey crossed from the Angel into St. John’s Road; struck down the small\\n\\nstreet which terminates at Sadler’s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth\\n\\nStreet and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the\\n\\nworkhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of\\n\\nHockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into\\n\\nSaffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace,\\n\\ndirecting Oliver to follow close at his heels.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of\\n\\nhis leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either\\n\\nside of the way, as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place\\n\\nhe had never seen. The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air\\n\\nwas impregnated with filthy odours.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade\\n\\nappeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were\\n\\ncrawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside. The\\n\\nsole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the\\n\\nplace, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish\\n\\nwere wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here\\n\\nand there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of\\n\\nhouses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth;\\n\\nand from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were\\n\\ncautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed\\n\\nor harmless errands.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver was just considering whether he hadn’t better run away, when\\n\\nthey reached the bottom of the hill. His conductor, catching him by the\\n\\narm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him\\n\\ninto the passage, closed it behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, then!” cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the\\n\\nDodger.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Plummy and slam!” was the reply.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the\\n\\nlight of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the\\n\\npassage; and a man’s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the\\n\\nold kitchen staircase had been broken away.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s two on you,” said the man, thrusting the candle farther out,\\n\\nand shielding his eyes with his hand. “Who’s the t’other one?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A new pal,” replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where did he come from?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Greenland. Is Fagin upstairs?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, he’s a sortin’ the wipes. Up with you!” The candle was drawn\\n\\nback, and the face disappeared.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly\\n\\ngrasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and\\n\\nbroken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition\\n\\nthat showed he was well acquainted with them.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and\\n\\ndirt. There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle,\\n\\nstuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and\\n\\nbutter, and a plate. In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and which\\n\\nwas secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking;\\n\\nand standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very\\n\\nold shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was\\n\\nobscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He was dressed in a greasy\\n\\nflannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his\\n\\nattention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which a\\n\\ngreat number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging. Several rough beds\\n\\nmade of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round\\n\\nthe table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking\\n\\nlong clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men.\\n\\nThese all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to\\n\\nthe Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver. So did the Jew\\n\\nhimself, toasting-fork in hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is him, Fagin,” said Jack Dawkins; “my friend Oliver Twist.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the\\n\\nhand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.\\n\\nUpon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook\\n\\nboth his hands very hard—especially the one in which he held his little\\n\\nbundle. One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for\\n\\nhim; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in\\n\\norder that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of\\n\\nemptying them, himself, when he went to bed. These civilities would\\n\\nprobably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the\\n\\nJew’s toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate\\n\\nyouths who offered them.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,” said the Jew. “Dodger,\\n\\ntake off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. Ah,\\n\\nyou’re a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear. There are a\\n\\ngood many of ’em, ain’t there? We’ve just looked ’em out, ready for the\\n\\nwash; that’s all, Oliver; that’s all. Ha! ha! ha!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from\\n\\nall the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of\\n\\nwhich they went to supper.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot\\n\\ngin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because\\n\\nanother gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he was desired.\\n\\nImmediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the\\n\\nsacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CHAPTER IX.\\n\\nCONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN,\\n\\nAND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.\\n\\nThere was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling\\n\\nsome coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to\\n\\nhimself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would\\n\\nstop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below:\\n\\nand when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and\\n\\nstirring again, as before.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly\\n\\nawake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you\\n\\ndream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half\\n\\nconscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in\\n\\nfive nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in\\n\\nperfect unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal knows just enough of\\n\\nwhat his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its\\n\\nmighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space,\\n\\nwhen freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his\\n\\nhalf-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of\\n\\nthe spoon grating against the saucepan’s sides: and yet the self-same\\n\\nsenses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with\\n\\nalmost everybody he had ever known.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.\\n\\nStanding, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he\\n\\ndid not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at\\n\\nOliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all\\n\\nappearances asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the\\n\\ndoor: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver,\\n\\nfrom some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on\\n\\nthe table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in.\\n\\nDragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a\\n\\nmagnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Aha!” said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every\\n\\nfeature with a hideous grin. “Clever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the\\n\\nlast! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old\\n\\nFagin! And why should they? It wouldn’t have loosened the knot, or kept\\n\\nthe drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!”\\n\\n\\n\\nWith these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew\\n\\nonce more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a\\n\\ndozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed\\n\\nwith equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other\\n\\narticles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly\\n\\nworkmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that\\n\\nit lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute\\n\\ninscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading\\n\\nit with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put\\n\\nit down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair,\\n\\nmuttered:\\n\\n\\n\\n“What a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead\\n\\nmen never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it’s a fine thing for the\\n\\ntrade! Five of ’em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or\\n\\nturn white-livered!”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been\\n\\nstaring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver’s face; the boy’s eyes were\\n\\nfixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only\\n\\nfor an instant—for the briefest space of time that can possibly be\\n\\nconceived—it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on\\n\\na bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled\\n\\nvery much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the\\n\\nknife quivered in the air.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s that?” said the Jew. “What do you watch me for? Why are you\\n\\nawake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick—quick! for your life.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wasn’t able to sleep any longer, sir,” replied Oliver, meekly. “I am\\n\\nvery sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You were not awake an hour ago?” said the Jew, scowling fiercely on\\n\\nthe boy.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No! No, indeed!” replied Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you sure?” cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before:\\n\\nand a threatening attitude.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Upon my word I was not, sir,” replied Oliver, earnestly. “I was not,\\n\\nindeed, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Tush, tush, my dear!” said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner,\\n\\nand playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to\\n\\ninduce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. “Of course I\\n\\nknow that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You’re a brave boy.\\n\\nHa! ha! you’re a brave boy, Oliver.” The Jew rubbed his hands with a\\n\\nchuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?” said the Jew, laying\\n\\nhis hand upon it after a short pause.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said the Jew, turning rather pale. “They—they’re mine, Oliver; my\\n\\nlittle property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks call\\n\\nme a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that’s all.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in\\n\\nsuch a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps\\n\\nhis fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of\\n\\nmoney, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he\\n\\nmight get up.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly, my dear, certainly,” replied the old gentleman. “Stay.\\n\\nThere’s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here;\\n\\nand I’ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to\\n\\nraise the pitcher. When he turned his head, the box was gone.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying\\n\\nthe basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew’s directions, when\\n\\nthe Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom\\n\\nOliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally\\n\\nintroduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on\\n\\nthe coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought\\n\\nhome in the crown of his hat.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself\\n\\nto the Dodger, “I hope you’ve been at work this morning, my dears?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hard,” replied the Dodger.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As nails,” added Charley Bates.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good boys, good boys!” said the Jew. “What have you got, Dodger?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A couple of pocket-books,” replied that young gentlman.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Lined?” inquired the Jew, with eagerness.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pretty well,” replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one\\n\\ngreen, and the other red.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not so heavy as they might be,” said the Jew, after looking at the\\n\\ninsides carefully; “but very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman,\\n\\nain’t he, Oliver?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very indeed, sir,” said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed\\n\\nuproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to\\n\\nlaugh at, in anything that had passed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And what have you got, my dear?” said Fagin to Charley Bates.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Wipes,” replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four\\n\\npocket-handkerchiefs.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the Jew, inspecting them closely; “they’re very good ones,\\n\\nvery. You haven’t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall\\n\\nbe picked out with a needle, and we’ll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall\\n\\nus, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you please, sir,” said Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley\\n\\nBates, wouldn’t you, my dear?” said the Jew.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very much, indeed, if you’ll teach me, sir,” replied Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaster Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that\\n\\nhe burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was\\n\\ndrinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly\\n\\nterminated in his premature suffocation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He is so jolly green!” said Charley when he recovered, as an apology\\n\\nto the company for his unpolite behaviour.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver’s hair over his eyes,\\n\\nand said he’d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman,\\n\\nobserving Oliver’s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking\\n\\nwhether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?\\n\\nThis made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies\\n\\nof the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally\\n\\nwondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very\\n\\nindustrious.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two\\n\\nboys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in\\n\\nthis way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of\\n\\nhis trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat\\n\\npocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond\\n\\npin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his\\n\\nspectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the\\n\\nroom with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen\\n\\nwalk about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the\\n\\nfire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was\\n\\nstaring with all his might into shop-windows. At such times, he would\\n\\nlook constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping\\n\\nall his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn’t lost anything, in such a\\n\\nvery funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran\\n\\ndown his face. All this time, the two boys followed him closely about:\\n\\ngetting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that\\n\\nit was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod\\n\\nupon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates\\n\\nstumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from\\n\\nhim, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case,\\n\\nwatch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the\\n\\nspectacle-case. If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his\\n\\npockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over\\n\\nagain.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young\\n\\nladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet,\\n\\nand the other Nancy. They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly\\n\\nturned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings.\\n\\nThey were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of\\n\\ncolour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being\\n\\nremarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them\\n\\nvery nice girls indeed. As there is no doubt they were.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence\\n\\nof one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and\\n\\nthe conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length,\\n\\nCharley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof.\\n\\nThis, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly\\n\\nafterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went\\n\\naway together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with\\n\\nmoney to spend.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There, my dear,” said Fagin. “That’s a pleasant life, isn’t it? They\\n\\nhave gone out for the day.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have they done work, sir?” inquired Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Jew; “that is, unless they should unexpectedly come\\n\\nacross any, when they are out; and they won’t neglect it, if they do,\\n\\nmy dear, depend upon it. Make ’em your models, my dear. Make ’em your\\n\\nmodels,” tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his\\n\\nwords; “do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all\\n\\nmatters—especially the Dodger’s, my dear. He’ll be a great man himself,\\n\\nand will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.—Is my\\n\\nhandkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?” said the Jew, stopping\\n\\nshort.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” said Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do,\\n\\nwhen we were at play this morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen\\n\\nthe Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with\\n\\nthe other.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is it gone?” cried the Jew.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Here it is, sir,” said Oliver, showing it in his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re a clever boy, my dear,” said the playful old gentleman, patting\\n\\nOliver on the head approvingly. “I never saw a sharper lad. Here’s a\\n\\nshilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you’ll be the greatest man\\n\\nof the time. And now come here, and I’ll show you how to take the marks\\n\\nout of the handkerchiefs.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver wondered what picking the old gentleman’s pocket in play, had to\\n\\ndo with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew,\\n\\nbeing so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to\\n\\nthe table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CHAPTER X.\\n\\nOLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW\\n\\nASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT,\\n\\nBUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor many days, Oliver remained in the Jew’s room, picking the marks out\\n\\nof the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought\\n\\nhome,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which\\n\\nthe two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length,\\n\\nhe began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of\\n\\nearnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work\\n\\nwith his two companions.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what\\n\\nhe had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman’s character.\\n\\nWhenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed,\\n\\nhe would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy\\n\\nhabits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by\\n\\nsending them supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went\\n\\nso far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was\\n\\ncarrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so\\n\\neagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two\\n\\nor three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these\\n\\nwere reasons for the old gentleman’s giving his assent; but, whether\\n\\nthey were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the\\n\\njoint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up,\\n\\nand his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his\\n\\nhands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they\\n\\nwere going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in,\\n\\nfirst.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter,\\n\\nthat Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive\\n\\nthe old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a\\n\\nvicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small\\n\\nboys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some\\n\\nvery loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering\\n\\ndivers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and\\n\\nthrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that\\n\\nthey seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.\\n\\nThese things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring\\n\\nhis intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when\\n\\nhis thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very\\n\\nmysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open\\n\\nsquare in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion\\n\\nof terms, “The Green”: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying\\n\\nhis finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the\\n\\ngreatest caution and circumspection.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” demanded Oliver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hush!” replied the Dodger. “Do you see that old cove at the\\n\\nbook-stall?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The old gentleman over the way?” said Oliver. “Yes, I see him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He’ll do,” said the Dodger.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A prime plant,” observed Master Charley Bates.\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he\\n\\nwas not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked\\n\\nstealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman\\n\\ntowards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces\\n\\nafter them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood\\n\\nlooking on in silent amazement.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a\\n\\npowdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green\\n\\ncoat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a\\n\\nsmart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall,\\n\\nand there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his\\n\\nelbow-chair, in his own study. It is very possible that he fancied\\n\\nhimself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he\\n\\nsaw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short,\\n\\nanything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through:\\n\\nturning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at\\n\\nthe top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest\\n\\ninterest and eagerness.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat was Oliver’s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking\\n\\non with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the\\n\\nDodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman’s pocket, and draw from\\n\\nthence a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and\\n\\nfinally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full\\n\\nspeed!\\n\\n\\n\\nIn an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches,\\n\\nand the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy’s mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his\\n\\nveins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then,\\n\\nconfused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he\\n\\ndid, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was all done in a minute’s space. In the very instant when Oliver\\n\\nbegan to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and\\n\\nmissing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding\\n\\naway at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the\\n\\ndepredator; and shouting “Stop thief!” with all his might, made off\\n\\nafter him, book in hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the\\n\\nhue-and-cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public\\n\\nattention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the\\n\\nvery first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and\\n\\nsaw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they\\n\\nissued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting “Stop thief!” too,\\n\\njoined in the pursuit like good citizens.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not\\n\\ntheoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that\\n\\nself-preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps\\n\\nhe would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it\\n\\nalarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old\\n\\ngentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Stop thief! Stop thief!” There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman\\n\\nleaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down\\n\\nhis tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy\\n\\nhis parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the\\n\\nchild his battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter,\\n\\nslap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as\\n\\nthey turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls:\\n\\nand streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Stop thief! Stop thief!” The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and\\n\\nthe crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through\\n\\nthe mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run\\n\\nthe people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the\\n\\nvery thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the\\n\\nshout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, “Stop thief! Stop thief!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Stop thief! Stop thief!” There is a passion FOR _hunting_ _something_\\n\\ndeeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched breathless child,\\n\\npanting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large\\n\\ndrops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to\\n\\nmake head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain\\n\\nupon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy.\\n\\n“Stop thief!” Ay, stop him for God’s sake, were it only in mercy!\\n\\n\\n\\nStopped at last! A clever blow. He is down upon the pavement; and the\\n\\ncrowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling\\n\\nwith the others to catch a glimpse. “Stand aside!” “Give him a little\\n\\nair!” “Nonsense! he don’t deserve it.” “Where’s the gentleman?” “Here\\n\\nhis is, coming down the street.” “Make room there for the gentleman!”\\n\\n“Is this the boy, sir!” “Yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth,\\n\\nlooking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when\\n\\nthe old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by\\n\\nthe foremost of the pursuers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said the gentleman, “I am afraid it is the boy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Afraid!” murmured the crowd. “That’s a good ’un!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Poor fellow!” said the gentleman, “he has hurt himself.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_I_ did that, sir,” said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward;\\n\\n“and preciously I cut my knuckle agin’ his mouth. I stopped him, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his\\n\\npains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of\\n\\ndislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away\\n\\nhimself: which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and\\n\\nthus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is\\n\\ngenerally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made\\n\\nhis way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come, get up,” said the man, roughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It wasn’t me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,” said\\n\\nOliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round. “They are\\n\\nhere somewhere.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh no, they ain’t,” said the officer. He meant this to be ironical,\\n\\nbut it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off\\n\\ndown the first convenient court they came to.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come, get up!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t hurt him,” said the old gentleman, compassionately.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh no, I won’t hurt him,” replied the officer, tearing his jacket half\\n\\noff his back, in proof thereof. “Come, I know you; it won’t do. Will\\n\\nyou stand upon your legs, you young devil?”\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his\\n\\nfeet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at\\n\\na rapid pace. The gentleman walked on with them by the officer’s side;\\n\\nand as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead,\\n\\nand stared back at Oliver from time to time. The boys shouted in\\n\\ntriumph; and on they went.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE  CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH      Among other public buildings in a certain town which for many reasons  it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning and to which I will  assign no fictitious name there is one anciently common to most towns  great or small to wit a workhouse and in this workhouse was born on  a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat inasmuch as  it can be of no possible consequence to the reader in this stage of  the business at all events the item of mortality whose name is  prefixed to the head of this chapter.    For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and  trouble by the parish surgeon it remained a matter of considerable  doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all in which  case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never  have appeared or if they had that being comprised within a couple of  pages they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the  most concise and faithful specimen of biography extant in the  literature of any age or country.    Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a  workhouse is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance  that can possibly befall a human being I do mean to say that in this  particular instance it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could  by possibility have occurred. The fact is that there was considerable  difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of  respiration—a troublesome practice but one which custom has rendered  necessary to our easy existence and for some time he lay gasping on a  little flock mattress rather unequally poised between this world and  the next the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now if  during this brief period Oliver had been surrounded by careful  grandmothers anxious aunts experienced nurses and doctors of  profound wisdom he would most inevitably and indubitably have been  killed in no time. There being nobody by however but a pauper old  woman who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer  and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract Oliver and  Nature fought out the point between them. The result was that after a  few struggles Oliver breathed sneezed and proceeded to advertise to  the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been  imposed upon the parish by setting up as loud a cry as could  reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been  possessed of that very useful appendage a voice for a much longer  space of time than three minutes and a quarter.    As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his  lungs the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron  bedstead rustled the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly  from the pillow and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words  Let me see the child and die.    The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire  giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the  young woman spoke he rose and advancing to the beds head said with  more kindness than might have been expected of him    Oh you must not talk about dying yet.    Lor bless her dear heart no interposed the nurse hastily  depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle the contents of which  she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.    Lor bless her dear heart when she has lived as long as I have sir  and had thirteen children of her own and all on em dead except two  and them in the wurkus with me shell know better than to take on in  that way bless her dear heart Think what it is to be a mother  theres a dear young lamb do.    Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mothers prospects failed  in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head and stretched  out her hand towards the child.    The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips  passionately on its forehead passed her hands over her face gazed  wildly round shuddered fell back—and died. They chafed her breast  hands and temples but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of  hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.    Its all over Mrs. Thingummy said the surgeon at last.    Ah poor dear so it is said the nurse picking up the cork of the  green bottle which had fallen out on the pillow as she stooped to  take up the child. Poor dear    You neednt mind sending up to me if the child cries nurse said  the surgeon putting on his gloves with great deliberation. Its very  likely it will be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is. He  put on his hat and pausing by the bedside on his way to the door  added She was a goodlooking girl too where did she come from    She was brought here last night replied the old woman by the  overseers order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked  some distance for her shoes were worn to pieces but where she came  from or where she was going to nobody knows.    The surgeon leaned over the body and raised the left hand. The old  story he said shaking his head no weddingring I see. Ah  Goodnight    The medical gentleman walked away to dinner and the nurse having once  more applied herself to the green bottle sat down on a low chair  before the fire and proceeded to dress the infant.    What an excellent example of the power of dress young Oliver Twist  was Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only  covering he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar it  would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him  his proper station in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old  calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service he was badged  and ticketed and fell into his place at once—a parish child—the orphan  of a workhouse—the humble halfstarved drudge—to be cuffed and  buffeted through the world—despised by all and pitied by none.    Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan  left to the tender mercies of churchwardens and overseers perhaps he  would have cried the louder.           CHAPTER II.  TREATS OF OLIVER TWISTS GROWTH EDUCATION AND BOARD      For the next eight or ten months Oliver was the victim of a systematic  course of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The  hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported  by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish  authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities whether  there was no female then domiciled in the house who was in a  situation to impart to Oliver Twist the consolation and nourishment of  which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with  humility that there was not. Upon this the parish authorities  magnanimously and humanely resolved that Oliver should be farmed  or in other words that he should be dispatched to a branchworkhouse  some three miles off where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders  against the poorlaws rolled about the floor all day without the  inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing under the parental  superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and  for the consideration of sevenpencehalfpenny per small head per week.  Sevenpencehalfpennys worth per week is a good round diet for a child  a great deal may be got for sevenpencehalfpenny quite enough to  overload its stomach and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was  a woman of wisdom and experience she knew what was good for children  and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.  So she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own  use and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter  allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the  lowest depth a deeper still and proving herself a very great  experimental philosopher.    Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a  great theory about a horse being able to live without eating and who  demonstrated it so well that he had got his own horse down to a straw  a day and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and  rampacious animal on nothing at all if he had not died  fourandtwenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable  bait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the  female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over a  similar result usually attended the operation of her system for at  the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest  possible portion of the weakest possible food it did perversely happen  in eight and a half cases out of ten either that it sickened from want  and cold or fell into the fire from neglect or got halfsmothered by  accident in any one of which cases the miserable little being was  usually summoned into another world and there gathered to the fathers  it had never known in this.    Occasionally when there was some more than usually interesting inquest  upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead  or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a  washing—though the latter accident was very scarce anything  approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm—the jury  would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions or the  parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a  remonstrance. But these impertinences were speedily checked by the  evidence of the surgeon and the testimony of the beadle the former of  whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside which was  very probable indeed and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever  the parish wanted which was very selfdevotional. Besides the board  made periodical pilgrimages to the farm and always sent the beadle the  day before to say they were going. The children were neat and clean to  behold when they went and what more would the people have    It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any  very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twists ninth birthday  found him a pale thin child somewhat diminutive in stature and  decidedly small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had  implanted a good sturdy spirit in Olivers breast. It had had plenty of  room to expand thanks to the spare diet of the establishment and  perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth  birthday at all. Be this as it may however it was his ninth  birthday and he was keeping it in the coalcellar with a select party  of two other young gentleman who after participating with him in a  sound thrashing had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be  hungry when Mrs. Mann the good lady of the house was unexpectedly  startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble the beadle striving to undo  the wicket of the gardengate.    Goodness gracious Is that you Mr. Bumble sir said Mrs. Mann  thrusting her head out of the window in wellaffected ecstasies of joy.  Susan take Oliver and them two brats upstairs and wash em  directly.—My heart alive Mr. Bumble how glad I am to see you  surely    Now Mr. Bumble was a fat man and a choleric so instead of  responding to this openhearted salutation in a kindred spirit he gave  the little wicket a tremendous shake and then bestowed upon it a kick  which could have emanated from no leg but a beadles.    Lor only think said Mrs. Mann running out—for the three boys had  been removed by this time—only think of that That I should have  forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside on account of them  dear children Walk in sir walk in pray Mr. Bumble do sir.    Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have  softened the heart of a churchwarden it by no means mollified the  beadle.    Do you think this respectful or proper conduct Mrs. Mann inquired  Mr. Bumble grasping his cane to keep the parish officers a waiting  at your gardengate when they come here upon porochial business with  the porochial orphans Are you aweer Mrs. Mann that you are as I may  say a porochial delegate and a stipendiary    Im sure Mr. Bumble that I was only a telling one or two of the dear  children as is so fond of you that it was you a coming replied Mrs.  Mann with great humility.    Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his  importance. He had displayed the one and vindicated the other. He  relaxed.    Well well Mrs. Mann he replied in a calmer tone it may be as you  say it may be. Lead the way in Mrs. Mann for I come on business and  have something to say.    Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor  placed a seat for him and officiously deposited his cocked hat and  cane on the table before him. Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the  perspiration which his walk had engendered glanced complacently at the  cocked hat and smiled. Yes he smiled. Beadles are but men and Mr.  Bumble smiled.    Now dont you be offended at what Im a going to say observed Mrs.  Mann with captivating sweetness. Youve had a long walk you know or  I wouldnt mention it. Now will you take a little drop of somethink  Mr. Bumble    Not a drop. Nor a drop said Mr. Bumble waving his right hand in a  dignified but placid manner.    I think you will said Mrs. Mann who had noticed the tone of the  refusal and the gesture that had accompanied it. Just a leetle drop  with a little cold water and a lump of sugar.    Mr. Bumble coughed.    Now just a leetle drop said Mrs. Mann persuasively.    What is it inquired the beadle.    Why its what Im obliged to keep a little of in the house to put  into the blessed infants Daffy when they aint well Mr. Bumble  replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard and took down a  bottle and glass. Its gin. Ill not deceive you Mr. B. Its gin.    Do you give the children Daffy Mrs. Mann inquired Bumble following  with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.    Ah bless em that I do dear as it is replied the nurse. I  couldnt see em suffer before my very eyes you know sir.    No said Mr. Bumble approvingly no you could not. You are a humane  woman Mrs. Mann. Here she set down the glass. I shall take a early  opportunity of mentioning it to the board Mrs. Mann. He drew it  towards him. You feel as a mother Mrs. Mann. He stirred the  ginandwater. I—I drink your health with cheerfulness Mrs. Mann  and he swallowed half of it.    And now about business said the beadle taking out a leathern  pocketbook. The child that was halfbaptized Oliver Twist is nine  year old today.    Bless him interposed Mrs. Mann inflaming her left eye with the  corner of her apron.    And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound which was  afterwards increased to twenty pound. Notwithstanding the most  superlative and I may say supernatral exertions on the part of this  parish said Bumble we have never been able to discover who is his  father or what was his mothers settlement name or condition.    Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment but added after a moments  reflection How comes he to have any name at all then    The beadle drew himself up with great pride and said I inwented it.    You Mr. Bumble    I Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last  was a S—Swubble I named him. This was a T—Twist I named him. The  next one comes will be Unwin and the next Vilkins. I have got names  ready made to the end of the alphabet and all the way through it  again when we come to Z.    Why youre quite a literary character sir said Mrs. Mann.    Well well said the beadle evidently gratified with the compliment  perhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be Mrs. Mann. He finished the  ginandwater and added Oliver being now too old to remain here the  board have determined to have him back into the house. I have come out  myself to take him there. So let me see him at once.    Ill fetch him directly said Mrs. Mann leaving the room for that  purpose. Oliver having had by this time as much of the outer coat of  dirt which encrusted his face and hands removed as could be scrubbed  off in one washing was led into the room by his benevolent  protectress.    Make a bow to the gentleman Oliver said Mrs. Mann.    Oliver made a bow which was divided between the beadle on the chair  and the cocked hat on the table.    Will you go along with me Oliver said Mr. Bumble in a majestic  voice.    Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great  readiness when glancing upward he caught sight of Mrs. Mann who had  got behind the beadles chair and was shaking her fist at him with a  furious countenance. He took the hint at once for the fist had been  too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his  recollection.    Will she go with me inquired poor Oliver.    No she cant replied Mr. Bumble. But shell come and see you  sometimes.    This was no very great consolation to the child. Young as he was  however he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at  going away. It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears  into his eyes. Hunger and recent illusage are great assistants if you  want to cry and Oliver cried very naturally indeed. Mrs. Mann gave him  a thousand embraces and what Oliver wanted a great deal more a piece  of bread and butter less he should seem too hungry when he got to the  workhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand and the little  browncloth parish cap on his head Oliver was then led away by Mr.  Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never  lighted the gloom of his infant years. And yet he burst into an agony  of childish grief as the cottagegate closed after him. Wretched as  were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind they were  the only friends he had ever known and a sense of his loneliness in  the great wide world sank into the childs heart for the first time.    Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides little Oliver firmly grasping  his goldlaced cuff trotted beside him inquiring at the end of every  quarter of a mile whether they were nearly there. To these  interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies for  the temporary blandness which ginandwater awakens in some bosoms had  by this time evaporated and he was once again a beadle.    Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an  hour and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of  bread when Mr. Bumble who had handed him over to the care of an old  woman returned and telling him it was a board night informed him  that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.    Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was  Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence and was not quite  certain whether he ought to laugh or cry. He had no time to think about  the matter however for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head with  his cane to wake him up and another on the back to make him lively  and bidding him to follow conducted him into a large whitewashed  room where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table. At  the top of the table seated in an armchair rather higher than the  rest was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round red face.    Bow to the board said Bumble. Oliver brushed away two or three tears  that were lingering in his eyes and seeing no board but the table  fortunately bowed to that.    Whats your name boy said the gentleman in the high chair.    Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen which made him  tremble and the beadle gave him another tap behind which made him  cry. These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating  voice whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool.  Which was a capital way of raising his spirits and putting him quite  at his ease.    Boy said the gentleman in the high chair listen to me. You know  youre an orphan I suppose    Whats that sir inquired poor Oliver.    The boy is a fool—I thought he was said the gentleman in the white  waistcoat.    Hush said the gentleman who had spoken first. You know youve got  no father or mother and that you were brought up by the parish dont  you    Yes sir replied Oliver weeping bitterly.    What are you crying for inquired the gentleman in the white  waistcoat. And to be sure it was very extraordinary. What could the  boy be crying for    I hope you say your prayers every night said another gentleman in a  gruff voice and pray for the people who feed you and take care of  you—like a Christian.    Yes sir stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was  unconsciously right. It would have been very like a Christian and a  marvellously good Christian too if Oliver had prayed for the people  who fed and took care of him. But he hadnt because nobody had  taught him.    Well You have come here to be educated and taught a useful trade  said the redfaced gentleman in the high chair.    So youll begin to pick oakum tomorrow morning at six oclock added  the surly one in the white waistcoat.    For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process  of picking oakum Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle and  was then hurried away to a large ward where on a rough hard bed he  sobbed himself to sleep. What a novel illustration of the tender laws  of England They let the paupers go to sleep    Poor Oliver He little thought as he lay sleeping in happy  unconsciousness of all around him that the board had that very day  arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence  over all his future fortunes. But they had. And this was it    The members of this board were very sage deep philosophical men and  when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse they found out  at once what ordinary folks would never have discovered—the poor  people liked it It was a regular place of public entertainment for the  poorer classes a tavern where there was nothing to pay a public  breakfast dinner tea and supper all the year round a brick and  mortar elysium where it was all play and no work. Oho said the  board looking very knowing we are the fellows to set this to rights  well stop it all in no time. So they established the rule that all  poor people should have the alternative for they would compel nobody  not they of being starved by a gradual process in the house or by a  quick one out of it. With this view they contracted with the  waterworks to lay on an unlimited supply of water and with a  cornfactor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal and  issued three meals of thin gruel a day with an onion twice a week and  half a roll of Sundays. They made a great many other wise and humane  regulations having reference to the ladies which it is not necessary  to repeat kindly undertook to divorce poor married people in  consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors Commons and  instead of compelling a man to support his family as they had  theretofore done took his family away from him and made him a  bachelor There is no saying how many applicants for relief under  these last two heads might have started up in all classes of society  if it had not been coupled with the workhouse but the board were  longheaded men and had provided for this difficulty. The relief was  inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel and that frightened  people.    For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed the system was  in full operation. It was rather expensive at first in consequence of  the increase in the undertakers bill and the necessity of taking in  the clothes of all the paupers which fluttered loosely on their  wasted shrunken forms after a week or twos gruel. But the number of  workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers and the board were  in ecstasies.    The room in which the boys were fed was a large stone hall with a  copper at one end out of which the master dressed in an apron for the  purpose and assisted by one or two women ladled the gruel at  mealtimes. Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer and  no more—except on occasions of great public rejoicing when he had two  ounces and a quarter of bread besides.    The bowls never wanted washing. The boys polished them with their  spoons till they shone again and when they had performed this  operation which never took very long the spoons being nearly as large  as the bowls they would sit staring at the copper with such eager  eyes as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was  composed employing themselves meanwhile in sucking their fingers  most assiduously with the view of catching up any stray splashes of  gruel that might have been cast thereon. Boys have generally excellent  appetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of  slow starvation for three months at last they got so voracious and  wild with hunger that one boy who was tall for his age and hadnt  been used to that sort of thing for his father had kept a small  cookshop hinted darkly to his companions that unless he had another  basin of gruel per diem he was afraid he might some night happen to  eat the boy who slept next him who happened to be a weakly youth of  tender age. He had a wild hungry eye and they implicitly believed  him. A council was held lots were cast who should walk up to the  master after supper that evening and ask for more and it fell to  Oliver Twist.    The evening arrived the boys took their places. The master in his  cooks uniform stationed himself at the copper his pauper assistants  ranged themselves behind him the gruel was served out and a long  grace was said over the short commons. The gruel disappeared the boys  whispered each other and winked at Oliver while his next neighbors  nudged him. Child as he was he was desperate with hunger and reckless  with misery. He rose from the table and advancing to the master basin  and spoon in hand said somewhat alarmed at his own temerity    Please sir I want some more.    The master was a fat healthy man but he turned very pale. He gazed in  stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds and then  clung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with  wonder the boys with fear.    What said the master at length in a faint voice.    Please sir replied Oliver I want some more.    The master aimed a blow at Olivers head with the ladle pinioned him  in his arm and shrieked aloud for the beadle.    The board were sitting in solemn conclave when Mr. Bumble rushed into  the room in great excitement and addressing the gentleman in the high  chair said    Mr. Limbkins I beg your pardon sir Oliver Twist has asked for  more    There was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance.    For more said Mr. Limbkins. Compose yourself Bumble and answer  me distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more after he had  eaten the supper allotted by the dietary    He did sir replied Bumble.    That boy will be hung said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. I  know that boy will be hung.    Nobody controverted the prophetic gentlemans opinion. An animated  discussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant confinement and  a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate offering a  reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the  hands of the parish. In other words five pounds and Oliver Twist were  offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade  business or calling.    I never was more convinced of anything in my life said the gentleman  in the white waistcoat as he knocked at the gate and read the bill  next morning I never was more convinced of anything in my life than  I am that that boy will come to be hung.    As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated  gentleman was right or not I should perhaps mar the interest of this  narrative supposing it to possess any at all if I ventured to hint  just yet whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination  or no.           CHAPTER III.  RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT  HAVE BEEN A SINECURE      For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of  asking for more Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and  solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of  the board. It appears at first sight not unreasonable to suppose  that if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the  prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat he would have  established that sage individuals prophetic character once and for  ever by tying one end of his pockethandkerchief to a hook in the  wall and attaching himself to the other. To the performance of this  feat however there was one obstacle namely that  pockethandkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury had been for  all future times and ages removed from the noses of paupers by the  express order of the board in council assembled solemnly given and  pronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still greater  obstacle in Olivers youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly all  day and when the long dismal night came on spread his little hands  before his eyes to shut out the darkness and crouching in the corner  tried to sleep ever and anon waking with a start and tremble and  drawing himself closer and closer to the wall as if to feel even its  cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which  surrounded him.    Let it not be supposed by the enemies of the system that during the  period of his solitary incarceration Oliver was denied the benefit of  exercise the pleasure of society or the advantages of religious  consolation. As for exercise it was nice cold weather and he was  allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump in a  stone yard in the presence of Mr. Bumble who prevented his catching  cold and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame by repeated  applications of the cane. As for society he was carried every other  day into the hall where the boys dined and there sociably flogged as a  public warning and example. And so far from being denied the advantages  of religious consolation he was kicked into the same apartment every  evening at prayertime and there permitted to listen to and console  his mind with a general supplication of the boys containing a special  clause therein inserted by authority of the board in which they  entreated to be made good virtuous contented and obedient and to be  guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist whom the supplication  distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection  of the powers of wickedness and an article direct from the manufactory  of the very Devil himself.    It chanced one morning while Olivers affairs were in this auspicious  and comfortable state that Mr. Gamfield chimneysweep went his way  down the High Street deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means  of paying certain arrears of rent for which his landlord had become  rather pressing. Mr. Gamfields most sanguine estimate of his finances  could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount  and in a species of arithmetical desperation he was alternately  cudgelling his brains and his donkey when passing the workhouse his  eyes encountered the bill on the gate.    Wo—o said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.    The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction wondering probably  whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbagestalk or two when  he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was  laden so without noticing the word of command he jogged onward.    Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally but  more particularly on his eyes and running after him bestowed a blow  on his head which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a  donkeys. Then catching hold of the bridle he gave his jaw a sharp  wrench by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master and  by these means turned him round. He then gave him another blow on the  head just to stun him till he came back again. Having completed these  arrangements he walked up to the gate to read the bill.    The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with  his hands behind him after having delivered himself of some profound  sentiments in the boardroom. Having witnessed the little dispute  between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey he smiled joyously when that  person came up to read the bill for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield  was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield  smiled too as he perused the document for five pounds was just the  sum he had been wishing for and as to the boy with which it was  encumbered Mr. Gamfield knowing what the dietary of the workhouse  was well knew he would be a nice small pattern just the very thing  for register stoves. So he spelt the bill through again from  beginning to end and then touching his fur cap in token of humility  accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.    This here boy sir wot the parish wants to prentis said Mr.  Gamfield.    Ay my man said the gentleman in the white waistcoat with a  condescending smile. What of him    If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade in a  good spectable chimbleysweepin bisness said Mr. Gamfield I wants  a prentis and I am ready to take him.    Walk in said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield  having lingered behind to give the donkey another blow on the head  and another wrench of the jaw as a caution not to run away in his  absence followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room  where Oliver had first seen him.    Its a nasty trade said Mr. Limbkins when Gamfield had again stated  his wish.    Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now said another  gentleman.    Thats acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley  to make em come down again said Gamfield thats all smoke and no  blaze vereas smoke aint o no use at all in making a boy come down  for it only sinds him to sleep and thats wot he likes. Boys is wery  obstinit and wery lazy Genlmen and theres nothink like a good hot  blaze to make em come down vith a run. Its humane too genlmen  acause even if theyve stuck in the chimbley roasting their feet  makes em struggle to hextricate theirselves.    The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this  explanation but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr.  Limbkins. The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a  few minutes but in so low a tone that the words saving of  expenditure looked well in the accounts have a printed report  published were alone audible. These only chanced to be heard indeed  or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.    At length the whispering ceased and the members of the board having  resumed their seats and their solemnity Mr. Limbkins said    We have considered your proposition and we dont approve of it.    Not at all said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.    Decidedly not added the other members.    As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of  having bruised three or four boys to death already it occurred to him  that the board had perhaps in some unaccountable freak taken it into  their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their  proceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business  if they had but still as he had no particular wish to revive the  rumour he twisted his cap in his hands and walked slowly from the  table.    So you wont let me have him genlmen said Mr. Gamfield pausing  near the door.    No replied Mr. Limbkins at least as its a nasty business we  think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.    Mr. Gamfields countenance brightened as with a quick step he  returned to the table and said    Whatll you give genlmen Come Dont be too hard on a poor man.  Whatll you give    I should say three pound ten was plenty said Mr. Limbkins.    Ten shillings too much said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.    Come said Gamfield say four pound genlmen. Say four pound and  youve got rid of him for good and all. There    Three pound ten repeated Mr. Limbkins firmly.    Come Ill split the difference genlmen urged Gamfield. Three  pound fifteen.    Not a farthing more was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.    Youre desperate hard upon me genlmen said Gamfield wavering.    Pooh pooh nonsense said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  Hed be cheap with nothing at all as a premium. Take him you silly  fellow Hes just the boy for you. He wants the stick now and then  itll do him good and his board neednt come very expensive for he  hasnt been overfed since he was born. Ha ha ha    Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table and  observing a smile on all of them gradually broke into a smile himself.  The bargain was made. Mr. Bumble was at once instructed that Oliver  Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate for  signature and approval that very afternoon.    In pursuance of this determination little Oliver to his excessive  astonishment was released from bondage and ordered to put himself  into a clean shirt. He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic  performance when Mr. Bumble brought him with his own hands a basin  of gruel and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of  bread. At this tremendous sight Oliver began to cry very piteously  thinking not unnaturally that the board must have determined to kill  him for some useful purpose or they never would have begun to fatten  him up in that way.    Dont make your eyes red Oliver but eat your food and be thankful  said Mr. Bumble in a tone of impressive pomposity. Youre a going to  be made a prentice of Oliver.    A prentice sir said the child trembling.    Yes Oliver said Mr. Bumble. The kind and blessed gentleman which  is so many parents to you Oliver when you have none of your own are  a going to prentice you and to set you up in life and make a man of  you although the expense to the parish is three pound ten—three pound  ten Oliver—seventy shillins—one hundred and forty sixpences—and all  for a naughty orphan which nobody cant love.    As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath after delivering this address in  an awful voice the tears rolled down the poor childs face and he  sobbed bitterly.    Come said Mr. Bumble somewhat less pompously for it was gratifying  to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced  Come Oliver Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket and dont  cry into your gruel thats a very foolish action Oliver. It  certainly was for there was quite enough water in it already.    On their way to the magistrate Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all  he would have to do would be to look very happy and say when the  gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed that he should like  it very much indeed both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey  the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint that if he failed in  either particular there was no telling what would be done to him. When  they arrived at the office he was shut up in a little room by himself  and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there until he came back to fetch  him.    There the boy remained with a palpitating heart for half an hour. At  the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head unadorned  with the cocked hat and said aloud    Now Oliver my dear come to the gentleman. As Mr. Bumble said this  he put on a grim and threatening look and added in a low voice Mind  what I told you you young rascal    Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumbles face at this somewhat  contradictory style of address but that gentleman prevented his  offering any remark thereupon by leading him at once into an adjoining  room the door of which was open. It was a large room with a great  window. Behind a desk sat two old gentleman with powdered heads one  of whom was reading the newspaper while the other was perusing with  the aid of a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles a small piece of  parchment which lay before him. Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of  the desk on one side and Mr. Gamfield with a partially washed face  on the other while two or three blufflooking men in topboots were  lounging about.    The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off over the  little bit of parchment and there was a short pause after Oliver had  been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.    This is the boy your worship said Mr. Bumble.    The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a  moment and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve whereupon  the lastmentioned old gentleman woke up.    Oh is this the boy said the old gentleman.    This is him sir replied Mr. Bumble. Bow to the magistrate my  dear.    Oliver roused himself and made his best obeisance. He had been  wondering with his eyes fixed on the magistrates powder whether all  boards were born with that white stuff on their heads and were boards  from thenceforth on that account.    Well said the old gentleman I suppose hes fond of  chimneysweeping    He doats on it your worship replied Bumble giving Oliver a sly  pinch to intimate that he had better not say he didnt.    And he will be a sweep will he inquired the old gentleman.    If we was to bind him to any other trade tomorrow hed run away  simultaneous your worship replied Bumble.    And this man thats to be his master—you sir—youll treat him well  and feed him and do all that sort of thing will you said the old  gentleman.    When I says I will I means I will replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.    Youre a rough speaker my friend but you look an honest  openhearted man said the old gentleman turning his spectacles in  the direction of the candidate for Olivers premium whose villainous  countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty. But the  magistrate was half blind and half childish so he couldnt reasonably  be expected to discern what other people did.    I hope I am sir said Mr. Gamfield with an ugly leer.    I have no doubt you are my friend replied the old gentleman fixing  his spectacles more firmly on his nose and looking about him for the  inkstand.    It was the critical moment of Olivers fate. If the inkstand had been  where the old gentleman thought it was he would have dipped his pen  into it and signed the indentures and Oliver would have been  straightway hurried off. But as it chanced to be immediately under his  nose it followed as a matter of course that he looked all over his  desk for it without finding it and happening in the course of his  search to look straight before him his gaze encountered the pale and  terrified face of Oliver Twist who despite all the admonitory looks  and pinches of Bumble was regarding the repulsive countenance of his  future master with a mingled expression of horror and fear too  palpable to be mistaken even by a halfblind magistrate.    The old gentleman stopped laid down his pen and looked from Oliver to  Mr. Limbkins who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and  unconcerned aspect.    My boy said the old gentleman you look pale and alarmed. What is  the matter    Stand a little away from him Beadle said the other magistrate  laying aside the paper and leaning forward with an expression of  interest. Now boy tell us whats the matter dont be afraid.    Oliver fell on his knees and clasping his hands together prayed that  they would order him back to the dark room—that they would starve  him—beat him—kill him if they pleased—rather than send him away with  that dreadful man.    Well said Mr. Bumble raising his hands and eyes with most  impressive solemnity. Well of all the artful and designing orphans  that ever I see Oliver you are one of the most barefacedest.    Hold your tongue Beadle said the second old gentleman when Mr.  Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.    I beg your worships pardon said Mr. Bumble incredulous of having  heard aright. Did your worship speak to me    Yes. Hold your tongue.    Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold  his tongue A moral revolution    The old gentleman in the tortoiseshell spectacles looked at his  companion he nodded significantly.    We refuse to sanction these indentures said the old gentleman  tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.    I hope stammered Mr. Limbkins I hope the magistrates will not form  the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper  conduct on the unsupported testimony of a child.    The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the  matter said the second old gentleman sharply. Take the boy back to  the workhouse and treat him kindly. He seems to want it.    That same evening the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively  and decidedly affirmed not only that Oliver would be hung but that he  would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his  head with gloomy mystery and said he wished he might come to good  whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied that he wished he might come to him  which although he agreed with the beadle in most matters would seem  to be a wish of a totally opposite description.    The next morning the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was  again To Let and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would  take possession of him.           CHAPTER IV.  OLIVER BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC  LIFE      In great families when an advantageous place cannot be obtained  either in possession reversion remainder or expectancy for the  young man who is growing up it is a very general custom to send him to  sea. The board in imitation of so wise and salutary an example took  counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist in  some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port. This  suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done  with him the probability being that the skipper would flog him to  death in a playful mood some day after dinner or would knock his  brains out with an iron bar both pastimes being as is pretty  generally known very favourite and common recreations among gentleman  of that class. The more the case presented itself to the board in this  point of view the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared  so they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for  Oliver effectually was to send him to sea without delay.    Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries  with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a  cabinboy without any friends and was returning to the workhouse to  communicate the result of his mission when he encountered at the gate  no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry the parochial undertaker.    Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt largejointed man attired in a suit  of threadbare black with darned cotton stockings of the same colour  and shoes to answer. His features were not naturally intended to wear a  smiling aspect but he was in general rather given to professional  jocosity. His step was elastic and his face betokened inward  pleasantry as he advanced to Mr. Bumble and shook him cordially by  the hand.    I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night Mr.  Bumble said the undertaker.    Youll make your fortune Mr. Sowerberry said the beadle as he  thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuffbox of the  undertaker which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. I  say youll make your fortune Mr. Sowerberry repeated Mr. Bumble  tapping the undertaker on the shoulder in a friendly manner with his  cane.    Think so said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half  disputed the probability of the event. The prices allowed by the board  are very small Mr. Bumble.    So are the coffins replied the beadle with precisely as near an  approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.    Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this as of course he ought to be  and laughed a long time without cessation. Well well Mr. Bumble he  said at length theres no denying that since the new system of  feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more  shallow than they used to be but we must have some profit Mr. Bumble.  Wellseasoned timber is an expensive article sir and all the iron  handles come by canal from Birmingham.    Well well said Mr. Bumble every trade has its drawbacks. A fair  profit is of course allowable.    Of course of course replied the undertaker and if I dont get a  profit upon this or that particular article why I make it up in the  longrun you see—he he he    Just so said Mr. Bumble.    Though I must say continued the undertaker resuming the current of  observations which the beadle had interrupted though I must say Mr.  Bumble that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage  which is that all the stout people go off the quickest. The people who  have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the first  to sink when they come into the house and let me tell you Mr. Bumble  that three or four inches over ones calculation makes a great hole in  ones profits especially when one has a family to provide for sir.    As Mr. Sowerberry said this with the becoming indignation of an  illused man and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a  reflection on the honour of the parish the latter gentleman thought it  advisable to change the subject. Oliver Twist being uppermost in his  mind he made him his theme.    By the bye said Mr. Bumble you dont know anybody who wants a boy  do you A porochial prentis who is at present a deadweight a  millstone as I may say round the porochial throat Liberal terms Mr.  Sowerberry liberal terms As Mr. Bumble spoke he raised his cane to  the bill above him and gave three distinct raps upon the words five  pounds which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size.    Gadso said the undertaker taking Mr. Bumble by the giltedged  lappel of his official coat thats just the very thing I wanted to  speak to you about. You know—dear me what a very elegant button this  is Mr. Bumble I never noticed it before.    Yes I think it rather pretty said the beadle glancing proudly  downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. The  die is the same as the porochial seal—the Good Samaritan healing the  sick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyears  morning Mr. Sowerberry. I put it on I remember for the first time  to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway  at midnight.    I recollect said the undertaker. The jury brought it in ‘Died from  exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of life  didnt they    Mr. Bumble nodded.    And they made it a special verdict I think said the undertaker by  adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had—    Tush Foolery interposed the beadle. If the board attended to all  the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk theyd have enough to do.    Very true said the undertaker they would indeed.    Juries said Mr. Bumble grasping his cane tightly as was his wont  when working into a passion juries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling  wretches.    So they are said the undertaker.    They havent no more philosophy nor political economy about em than  that said the beadle snapping his fingers contemptuously.    No more they have acquiesced the undertaker.    I despise em said the beadle growing very red in the face.    So do I rejoined the undertaker.    And I only wish wed a jury of the independent sort in the house for  a week or two said the beadle the rules and regulations of the  board would soon bring their spirit down for em.    Let em alone for that replied the undertaker. So saying he smiled  approvingly to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer.    Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat took a handkerchief from the  inside of the crown wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his  rage had engendered fixed the cocked hat on again and turning to the  undertaker said in a calmer voice    Well what about the boy    Oh replied the undertaker why you know Mr. Bumble I pay a good  deal towards the poors rates.    Hem said Mr. Bumble. Well    Well replied the undertaker I was thinking that if I pay so much  towards em Ive a right to get as much out of em as I can Mr.  Bumble and so—I think Ill take the boy myself.    Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm and led him into the  building. Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes  and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening upon  liking—a phrase which means in the case of a parish apprentice that  if the master find upon a short trial that he can get enough work out  of a boy without putting too much food into him he shall have him for  a term of years to do what he likes with.    When little Oliver was taken before the gentlemen that evening and  informed that he was to go that night as general houselad to a  coffinmakers and that if he complained of his situation or ever  came back to the parish again he would be sent to sea there to be  drowned or knocked on the head as the case might be he evinced so  little emotion that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened  young rascal and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.    Now although it was very natural that the board of all people in the  world should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror  at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody they  were rather out in this particular instance. The simple fact was that  Oliver instead of possessing too little feeling possessed rather too  much and was in a fair way of being reduced for life to a state of  brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received. He  heard the news of his destination in perfect silence and having had  his luggage put into his hand—which was not very difficult to carry  inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper  parcel about half a foot square by three inches deep—he pulled his cap  over his eyes and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumbles coat  cuff was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.    For some time Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along without notice or remark  for the beadle carried his head very erect as a beadle always should  and it being a windy day little Oliver was completely enshrouded by  the skirts of Mr. Bumbles coat as they blew open and disclosed to  great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush kneebreeches. As  they drew near to their destination however Mr. Bumble thought it  expedient to look down and see that the boy was in good order for  inspection by his new master which he accordingly did with a fit and  becoming air of gracious patronage.    Oliver said Mr. Bumble.    Yes sir replied Oliver in a low tremulous voice.    Pull that cap off your eyes and hold up your head sir.    Although Oliver did as he was desired at once and passed the back of  his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes he left a tear in them  when he looked up at his conductor. As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon  him it rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another and another.  The child made a strong effort but it was an unsuccessful one.  Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumbles he covered his face with  both and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and  bony fingers.    Well exclaimed Mr. Bumble stopping short and darting at his little  charge a look of intense malignity. Well Of all the ungratefullest  and worstdisposed boys as ever I see Oliver you are the—    No no sir sobbed Oliver clinging to the hand which held the  wellknown cane no no sir I will be good indeed indeed indeed I  will sir I am a very little boy sir and it is so—so—    So what inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.    So lonely sir So very lonely cried the child. Everybody hates me.  Oh sir dont dont pray be cross to me The child beat his hand  upon his heart and looked in his companions face with tears of real  agony.    Mr. Bumble regarded Olivers piteous and helpless look with some  astonishment for a few seconds hemmed three or four times in a husky  manner and after muttering something about that troublesome cough  bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his  hand he walked on with him in silence.    The undertaker who had just put up the shutters of his shop was  making some entries in his daybook by the light of a most appropriate  dismal candle when Mr. Bumble entered.    Aha said the undertaker looking up from the book and pausing in  the middle of a word is that you Bumble    No one else Mr. Sowerberry replied the beadle. Here Ive brought  the boy. Oliver made a bow.    Oh thats the boy is it said the undertaker raising the candle  above his head to get a better view of Oliver. Mrs. Sowerberry will  you have the goodness to come here a moment my dear    Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop and  presented the form of a short thin squeezedup woman with a vixenish  countenance.    My dear said Mr. Sowerberry deferentially this is the boy from  the workhouse that I told you of. Oliver bowed again.    Dear me said the undertakers wife hes very small.    Why he is rather small replied Mr. Bumble looking at Oliver as  if it were his fault that he was no bigger he is small. Theres no  denying it. But hell grow Mrs. Sowerberry—hell grow.    Ah I dare say he will replied the lady pettishly on our victuals  and our drink. I see no saving in parish children not I for they  always cost more to keep than theyre worth. However men always think  they know best. There Get downstairs little bag o bones. With this  the undertakers wife opened a side door and pushed Oliver down a  steep flight of stairs into a stone cell damp and dark forming the  anteroom to the coalcellar and denominated kitchen wherein sat a  slatternly girl in shoes down at heel and blue worsted stockings very  much out of repair.    Here Charlotte said Mr. Sowerberry who had followed Oliver down  give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. He  hasnt come home since the morning so he may go without em. I dare  say the boy isnt too dainty to eat em—are you boy    Oliver whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat and who was  trembling with eagerness to devour it replied in the negative and a  plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.    I wish some wellfed philosopher whose meat and drink turn to gall  within him whose blood is ice whose heart is iron could have seen  Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.  I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver  tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine. There is only  one thing I should like better and that would be to see the  Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself with the same relish.    Well said the undertakers wife when Oliver had finished his  supper which she had regarded in silent horror and with fearful  auguries of his future appetite have you done    There being nothing eatable within his reach Oliver replied in the  affirmative.    Then come with me said Mrs. Sowerberry taking up a dim and dirty  lamp and leading the way upstairs your beds under the counter. You  dont mind sleeping among the coffins I suppose But it doesnt much  matter whether you do or dont for you cant sleep anywhere else.  Come dont keep me here all night    Oliver lingered no longer but meekly followed his new mistress.           CHAPTER V.  OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST  TIME HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTERS BUSINESS      Oliver being left to himself in the undertakers shop set the lamp  down on a workmans bench and gazed timidly about him with a feeling  of awe and dread which many people a good deal older than he will be  at no loss to understand. An unfinished coffin on black tressels which  stood in the middle of the shop looked so gloomy and deathlike that a  cold tremble came over him every time his eyes wandered in the  direction of the dismal object from which he almost expected to see  some frightful form slowly rear its head to drive him mad with terror.  Against the wall were ranged in regular array a long row of elm  boards cut in the same shape looking in the dim light like  highshouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.  Coffinplates elmchips brightheaded nails and shreds of black  cloth lay scattered on the floor and the wall behind the counter was  ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff  neckcloths on duty at a large private door with a hearse drawn by  four black steeds approaching in the distance. The shop was close and  hot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. The  recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust  looked like a grave.    Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was  alone in a strange place and we all know how chilled and desolate the  best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no  friends to care for or to care for him. The regret of no recent  separation was fresh in his mind the absence of no loved and  wellremembered face sank heavily into his heart.    But his heart was heavy notwithstanding and he wished as he crept  into his narrow bed that that were his coffin and that he could be  lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground with the  tall grass waving gently above his head and the sound of the old deep  bell to soothe him in his sleep.    Oliver was awakened in the morning by a loud kicking at the outside of  the shopdoor which before he could huddle on his clothes was  repeated in an angry and impetuous manner about twentyfive times.  When he began to undo the chain the legs desisted and a voice began.    Open the door will yer cried the voice which belonged to the legs  which had kicked at the door.    I will directly sir replied Oliver undoing the chain and turning  the key.    I suppose yer the new boy aint yer said the voice through the  keyhole.    Yes sir replied Oliver.    How old are yer inquired the voice.    Ten sir replied Oliver.    Then Ill whop yer when I get in said the voice you just see if I  dont thats all my workus brat and having made this obliging  promise the voice began to whistle.    Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very  expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference to entertain the  smallest doubt that the owner of the voice whoever he might be would  redeem his pledge most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a  trembling hand and opened the door.    For a second or two Oliver glanced up the street and down the street  and over the way impressed with the belief that the unknown who had  addressed him through the keyhole had walked a few paces off to warm  himself for nobody did he see but a big charityboy sitting on a post  in front of the house eating a slice of bread and butter which he cut  into wedges the size of his mouth with a claspknife and then  consumed with great dexterity.    I beg your pardon sir said Oliver at length seeing that no other  visitor made his appearance did you knock    I kicked replied the charityboy.    Did you want a coffin sir inquired Oliver innocently.    At this the charityboy looked monstrous fierce and said that Oliver  would want one before long if he cut jokes with his superiors in that  way.    Yer dont know who I am I suppose Workus said the charityboy in  continuation descending from the top of the post meanwhile with  edifying gravity.    No sir rejoined Oliver.    Im Mister Noah Claypole said the charityboy and youre under me.  Take down the shutters yer idle young ruffian With this Mr.  Claypole administered a kick to Oliver and entered the shop with a  dignified air which did him great credit. It is difficult for a  largeheaded smalleyed youth of lumbering make and heavy  countenance to look dignified under any circumstances but it is more  especially so when superadded to these personal attractions are a red  nose and yellow smalls.    Oliver having taken down the shutters and broken a pane of glass in  his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a  small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the  day was graciously assisted by Noah who having consoled him with the  assurance that hed catch it condescended to help him. Mr.  Sowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards Mrs. Sowerberry  appeared. Oliver having caught it in fulfilment of Noahs  prediction followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.    Come near the fire Noah said Charlotte. I saved a nice little bit  of bacon for you from masters breakfast. Oliver shut that door at  Mister Noahs back and take them bits that Ive put out on the cover  of the breadpan. Theres your tea take it away to that box and drink  it there and make haste for theyll want you to mind the shop. Dye  hear    Dye hear Workus said Noah Claypole.    Lor Noah said Charlotte what a rum creature you are Why dont  you let the boy alone    Let him alone said Noah. Why everybody lets him alone enough for  the matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever  interfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty  well. Eh Charlotte He he he    Oh you queer soul said Charlotte bursting into a hearty laugh in  which she was joined by Noah after which they both looked scornfully  at poor Oliver Twist as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest  corner of the room and ate the stale pieces which had been specially  reserved for him.    Noah was a charityboy but not a workhouse orphan. No chancechild was  he for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents  who lived hard by his mother being a washerwoman and his father a  drunken soldier discharged with a wooden leg and a diurnal pension of  twopencehalfpenny and an unstateable fraction. The shopboys in the  neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public  streets with the ignominious epithets of leathers charity and  the like and Noah had bourne them without reply. But now that fortune  had cast in his way a nameless orphan at whom even the meanest could  point the finger of scorn he retorted on him with interest. This  affords charming food for contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful  thing human nature may be made to be and how impartially the same  amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest  charityboy.    Oliver had been sojourning at the undertakers some three weeks or a  month. Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry—the shop being shut up—were taking their  supper in the little backparlour when Mr. Sowerberry after several  deferential glances at his wife said    My dear— He was going to say more but Mrs. Sowerberry looking up  with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect he stopped short.    Well said Mrs. Sowerberry sharply.    Nothing my dear nothing said Mr. Sowerberry.    Ugh you brute said Mrs. Sowerberry.    Not at all my dear said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. I thought you  didnt want to hear my dear. I was only going to say—    Oh dont tell me what you were going to say interposed Mrs.  Sowerberry. I am nobody dont consult me pray. I dont want to  intrude upon your secrets. As Mrs. Sowerberry said this she gave an  hysterical laugh which threatened violent consequences.    But my dear said Sowerberry I want to ask your advice.    No no dont ask mine replied Mrs. Sowerberry in an affecting  manner ask somebody elses. Here there was another hysterical  laugh which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. This is a very common  and muchapproved matrimonial course of treatment which is often very  effective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging as a special  favour to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to  hear. After a short duration the permission was most graciously  conceded.    Its only about young Twist my dear said Mr. Sowerberry. A very  goodlooking boy that my dear.    He need be for he eats enough observed the lady.    Theres an expression of melancholy in his face my dear resumed Mr.  Sowerberry which is very interesting. He would make a delightful  mute my love.    Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable  wonderment. Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and without allowing time for  any observation on the good ladys part proceeded.    I dont mean a regular mute to attend grownup people my dear but  only for childrens practice. It would be very new to have a mute in  proportion my dear. You may depend upon it it would have a superb  effect.    Mrs. Sowerberry who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way  was much struck by the novelty of this idea but as it would have been  compromising her dignity to have said so under existing circumstances  she merely inquired with much sharpness why such an obvious  suggestion had not presented itself to her husbands mind before Mr.  Sowerberry rightly construed this as an acquiescence in his  proposition it was speedily determined therefore that Oliver should  be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade and with this  view that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of  his services being required.    The occasion was not long in coming. Half an hour after breakfast next  morning Mr. Bumble entered the shop and supporting his cane against  the counter drew forth his large leathern pocketbook from which he  selected a small scrap of paper which he handed over to Sowerberry.    Aha said the undertaker glancing over it with a lively countenance  an order for a coffin eh    For a coffin first and a porochial funeral afterwards replied Mr.  Bumble fastening the strap of the leathern pocketbook which like  himself was very corpulent.    Bayton said the undertaker looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.  Bumble. I never heard the name before.    Bumble shook his head as he replied Obstinate people Mr.  Sowerberry very obstinate. Proud too Im afraid sir.    Proud eh exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. Come thats too  much.    Oh its sickening replied the beadle. Antimonial Mr. Sowerberry    So it is acquiesced the undertaker.    We only heard of the family the night before last said the beadle  and we shouldnt have known anything about them then only a woman  who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial  committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was  very bad. He had gone out to dinner but his prentice which is a very  clever lad sent em some medicine in a blackingbottle offhand.    Ah theres promptness said the undertaker.    Promptness indeed replied the beadle. But whats the consequence  whats the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels sir Why the husband  sends back word that the medicine wont suit his wifes complaint and  so she shant take it—says she shant take it sir Good strong  wholesome medicine as was given with great success to two Irish  labourers and a coalheaver only a week before—sent em for nothing  with a blackinbottle in—and he sends back word that she shant take  it sir    As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumbles mind in full force he  struck the counter sharply with his cane and became flushed with  indignation.    Well said the undertaker I ne—ver—did—    Never did sir ejaculated the beadle. No nor nobody never did but  now shes dead weve got to bury her and thats the direction and  the sooner its done the better.    Thus saying Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first in a  fever of parochial excitement and flounced out of the shop.    Why he was so angry Oliver that he forgot even to ask after you  said Mr. Sowerberry looking after the beadle as he strode down the  street.    Yes sir replied Oliver who had carefully kept himself out of  sight during the interview and who was shaking from head to foot at  the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumbles voice.    He neednt haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumbles glance  however for that functionary on whom the prediction of the gentleman  in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression thought that  now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better  avoided until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years  and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish  should be thus effectually and legally overcome.    Well said Mr. Sowerberry taking up his hat the sooner this job is  done the better. Noah look after the shop. Oliver put on your cap  and come with me. Oliver obeyed and followed his master on his  professional mission.    They walked on for some time through the most crowded and densely  inhabited part of the town and then striking down a narrow street  more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through paused  to look for the house which was the object of their search. The houses  on either side were high and large but very old and tenanted by  people of the poorest class as their neglected appearance would have  sufficiently denoted without the concurrent testimony afforded by the  squalid looks of the few men and women who with folded arms and bodies  half doubled occasionally skulked along. A great many of the tenements  had shopfronts but these were fast closed and mouldering away only  the upper rooms being inhabited. Some houses which had become insecure  from age and decay were prevented from falling into the street by  huge beams of wood reared against the walls and firmly planted in the  road but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the  nightly haunts of some houseless wretches for many of the rough boards  which supplied the place of door and window were wrenched from their  positions to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human  body. The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The very rats which here and  there lay putrefying in its rottenness were hideous with famine.    There was neither knocker nor bellhandle at the open door where Oliver  and his master stopped so groping his way cautiously through the dark  passage and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the  undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs. Stumbling  against a door on the landing he rapped at it with his knuckles.    It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. The undertaker  at once saw enough of what the room contained to know it was the  apartment to which he had been directed. He stepped in Oliver followed  him.    There was no fire in the room but a man was crouching mechanically  over the empty stove. An old woman too had drawn a low stool to the  cold hearth and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged  children in another corner and in a small recess opposite the door  there lay upon the ground something covered with an old blanket.  Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place and crept  involuntarily closer to his master for though it was covered up the  boy felt that it was a corpse.    The mans face was thin and very pale his hair and beard were grizzly  his eyes were bloodshot. The old womans face was wrinkled her two  remaining teeth protruded over her under lip and her eyes were bright  and piercing. Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. They  seemed so like the rats he had seen outside.    Nobody shall go near her said the man starting fiercely up as the  undertaker approached the recess. Keep back Damn you keep back if  youve a life to lose    Nonsense my good man said the undertaker who was pretty well used  to misery in all its shapes. Nonsense    I tell you said the man clenching his hands and stamping furiously  on the floor—I tell you I wont have her put into the ground. She  couldnt rest there. The worms would worry her—not eat her—she is so  worn away.    The undertaker offered no reply to this raving but producing a tape  from his pocket knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.    Ah said the man bursting into tears and sinking on his knees at  the feet of the dead woman kneel down kneel down—kneel round her  every one of you and mark my words I say she was starved to death. I  never knew how bad she was till the fever came upon her and then her  bones were starting through the skin. There was neither fire nor  candle she died in the dark—in the dark She couldnt even see her  childrens faces though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged  for her in the streets and they sent me to prison. When I came back  she was dying and all the blood in my heart has dried up for they  starved her to death. I swear it before the God that saw it They  starved her He twined his hands in his hair and with a loud scream  rolled grovelling upon the floor his eyes fixed and the foam covering  his lips.    The terrified children cried bitterly but the old woman who had  hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that  passed menaced them into silence. Having unloosened the cravat of the  man who still remained extended on the ground she tottered towards the  undertaker.    She was my daughter said the old woman nodding her head in the  direction of the corpse and speaking with an idiotic leer more  ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. Lord Lord  Well it is strange that I who gave birth to her and was a woman  then should be alive and merry now and she lying there so cold and  stiff Lord Lord—to think of it its as good as a play—as good as a  play    As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment  the undertaker turned to go away.    Stop stop said the old woman in a loud whisper. Will she be buried  tomorrow or next day or tonight I laid her out and I must walk  you know. Send me a large cloak a good warm one for it is bitter  cold. We should have cake and wine too before we go Never mind send  some bread—only a loaf of bread and a cup of water. Shall we have some  bread dear she said eagerly catching at the undertakers coat as  he once more moved towards the door.    Yes yes said the undertakerof course. Anything you like He  disengaged himself from the old womans grasp and drawing Oliver  after him hurried away.    The next day the family having been meanwhile relieved with a  halfquartern loaf and a piece of cheese left with them by Mr. Bumble  himself Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode where  Mr. Bumble had already arrived accompanied by four men from the  workhouse who were to act as bearers. An old black cloak had been  thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man and the bare coffin  having been screwed down was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers  and carried into the street.    Now you must put your best leg foremost old lady whispered  Sowerberry in the old womans ear we are rather late and it wont  do to keep the clergyman waiting. Move on my men—as quick as you  like    Thus directed the bearers trotted on under their light burden and the  two mourners kept as near them as they could. Mr. Bumble and  Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front and Oliver whose legs  were not so long as his masters ran by the side.    There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had  anticipated however for when they reached the obscure corner of the  churchyard in which the nettles grew and where the parish graves were  made the clergyman had not arrived and the clerk who was sitting by  the vestryroom fire seemed to think it by no means improbable that it  might be an hour or so before he came. So they put the bier on the  brink of the grave and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp  clay with a cold rain drizzling down while the ragged boys whom the  spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at  hideandseek among the tombstones or varied their amusements by  jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin. Mr. Sowerberry and  Bumble being personal friends of the clerk sat by the fire with him  and read the paper.    At length after a lapse of something more than an hour Mr. Bumble  and Sowerberry and the clerk were seen running towards the grave.  Immediately afterwards the clergyman appeared putting on his surplice  as he came along. Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two to keep up  appearances and the reverend gentleman having read as much of the  burial service as could be compressed into four minutes gave his  surplice to the clerk and walked away again.    Now Bill said Sowerberry to the gravedigger. Fill up    It was no very difficult task for the grave was so full that the  uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface. The gravedigger  shovelled in the earth stamped it loosely down with his feet  shouldered his spade and walked off followed by the boys who  murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.    Come my good fellow said Bumble tapping the man on the back. They  want to shut up the yard.    The man who had never once moved since he had taken his station by the  grave side started raised his head stared at the person who had  addressed him walked forward for a few paces and fell down in a  swoon. The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss  of her cloak which the undertaker had taken off to pay him any  attention so they threw a can of cold water over him and when he came  to saw him safely out of the churchyard locked the gate and departed  on their different ways.    Well Oliver said Sowerberry as they walked home how do you like  it    Pretty well thank you sir replied Oliver with considerable  hesitation. Not very much sir.    Ah youll get used to it in time Oliver said Sowerberry. Nothing  when you are used to it my boy.    Oliver wondered in his own mind whether it had taken a very long time  to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it. But he thought it better not to ask  the question and walked back to the shop thinking over all he had  seen and heard.           CHAPTER VI.  OLIVER BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH ROUSES INTO ACTION AND  RATHER ASTONISHES HIM      The months trial over Oliver was formally apprenticed. It was a nice  sickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase coffins were  looking up and in the course of a few weeks Oliver acquired a great  deal of experience. The success of Mr. Sowerberrys ingenious  speculation exceeded even his most sanguine hopes. The oldest  inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so  prevalent or so fatal to infant existence and many were the mournful  processions which little Oliver headed in a hatband reaching down to  his knees to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the  mothers in the town. As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his  adult expeditions too in order that he might acquire that equanimity  of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a  finished undertaker he had many opportunities of observing the  beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strongminded  people bear their trials and losses.    For instance when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich  old lady or gentleman who was surrounded by a great number of nephews  and nieces who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous  illness and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most  public occasions they would be as happy among themselves as need  be—quite cheerful and contented—conversing together with as much  freedom and gaiety as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb  them. Husbands too bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic  calmness. Wives again put on weeds for their husbands as if so far  from grieving in the garb of sorrow they had made up their minds to  render it as becoming and attractive as possible. It was observable  too that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during  the ceremony of interment recovered almost as soon as they reached  home and became quite composed before the teadrinking was over. All  this was very pleasant and improving to see and Oliver beheld it with  great admiration.    That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good  people I cannot although I am his biographer undertake to affirm  with any degree of confidence but I can most distinctly say that for  many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and  illtreatment of Noah Claypole who used him far worse than before now  that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the  black stick and hatband while he the old one remained stationary in  the muffincap and leathers. Charlotte treated him ill because Noah  did and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy because Mr. Sowerberry  was disposed to be his friend so between these three on one side and  a glut of funerals on the other Oliver was not altogether as  comfortable as the hungry pig was when he was shut up by mistake in  the grain department of a brewery.    And now I come to a very important passage in Olivers history for I  have to record an act slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance  but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future  prospects and proceedings.    One day Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual  dinnerhour to banquet upon a small joint of mutton—a pound and a half  of the worst end of the neck—when Charlotte being called out of the  way there ensued a brief interval of time which Noah Claypole being  hungry and vicious considered he could not possibly devote to a  worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.    Intent upon this innocent amusement Noah put his feet on the  tablecloth and pulled Olivers hair and twitched his ears and  expressed his opinion that he was a sneak and furthermore announced  his intention of coming to see him hanged whenever that desirable  event should take place and entered upon various topics of petty  annoyance like a malicious and illconditioned charityboy as he was.  But making Oliver cry Noah attempted to be more facetious still and  in his attempt did what many sometimes do to this day when they want  to be funny. He got rather personal.    Workus said Noah hows your mother    Shes dead replied Oliver dont you say anything about her to me    Olivers colour rose as he said this he breathed quickly and there  was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils which Mr. Claypole  thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.  Under this impression he returned to the charge.    What did she die of Workus said Noah.    Of a broken heart some of our old nurses told me replied Oliver  more as if he were talking to himself than answering Noah. I think I  know what it must be to die of that    Tol de rol lol lol right fol lairy Workus said Noah as a tear  rolled down Olivers cheek. Whats set you a snivelling now    Not you replied Oliver sharply. There thats enough. Dont say  anything more to me about her youd better not    Better not exclaimed Noah. Well Better not Workus dont be  impudent. Your mother too She was a nice un she was. Oh Lor And  here Noah nodded his head expressively and curled up as much of his  small red nose as muscular action could collect together for the  occasion.    Yer know Workus continued Noah emboldened by Olivers silence  and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity of all tones the most  annoying Yer know Workus it cant be helped now and of course yer  couldnt help it then and I am very sorry for it and Im sure we all  are and pity yer very much. But yer must know Workus yer mother was  a regular rightdown bad un.    What did you say inquired Oliver looking up very quickly.    A regular rightdown bad un Workus replied Noah coolly. And  its a great deal better Workus that she died when she did or else  shed have been hard labouring in Bridewell or transported or hung  which is more likely than either isnt it    Crimson with fury Oliver started up overthrew the chair and table  seized Noah by the throat shook him in the violence of his rage till  his teeth chattered in his head and collecting his whole force into  one heavy blow felled him to the ground.    A minute ago the boy had looked the quiet child mild dejected  creature that harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused  at last the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire.  His breast heaved his attitude was erect his eye bright and vivid  his whole person changed as he stood glaring over the cowardly  tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet and defied him with an  energy he had never known before.    Hell murder me blubbered Noah. Charlotte missis Heres the new  boy a murdering of me Help help Olivers gone mad Char—lotte    Noahs shouts were responded to by a loud scream from Charlotte and a  louder from Mrs. Sowerberry the former of whom rushed into the kitchen  by a sidedoor while the latter paused on the staircase till she was  quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human  life to come further down.    Oh you little wretch screamed Charlotte seizing Oliver with her  utmost force which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man  in particularly good training. Oh you little ungrateful  murderous horrid villain And between every syllable Charlotte  gave Oliver a blow with all her might accompanying it with a scream  for the benefit of society.    Charlottes fist was by no means a light one but lest it should not  be effectual in calming Olivers wrath Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into  the kitchen and assisted to hold him with one hand while she  scratched his face with the other. In this favourable position of  affairs Noah rose from the ground and pommelled him behind.    This was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all  wearied out and could tear and beat no longer they dragged Oliver  struggling and shouting but nothing daunted into the dustcellar and  there locked him up. This being done Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a  chair and burst into tears.    Bless her shes going off said Charlotte. A glass of water Noah  dear. Make haste    Oh Charlotte said Mrs. Sowerberry speaking as well as she could  through a deficiency of breath and a sufficiency of cold water which  Noah had poured over her head and shoulders. Oh Charlotte what a  mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds    Ah mercy indeed maam was the reply. I only hope thisll teach  master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures that are born  to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah He was  all but killed maam when I come in.    Poor fellow said Mrs. Sowerberry looking piteously on the  charityboy.    Noah whose top waistcoatbutton might have been somewhere on a level  with the crown of Olivers head rubbed his eyes with the inside of his  wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him and performed  some affecting tears and sniffs.    Whats to be done exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. Your masters not at  home theres not a man in the house and hell kick that door down in  ten minutes. Olivers vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in  question rendered this occurance highly probable.    Dear dear I dont know maam said Charlotte unless we send for  the policeofficers.    Or the millingtary suggested Mr. Claypole.    No no said Mrs. Sowerberry bethinking herself of Olivers old  friend. Run to Mr. Bumble Noah and tell him to come here directly  and not to lose a minute never mind your cap Make haste You can hold  a knife to that black eye as you run along. Itll keep the swelling  down.    Noah stopped to make no reply but started off at his fullest speed  and very much it astonished the people who were out walking to see a  charityboy tearing through the streets pellmell with no cap on his  head and a claspknife at his eye.           CHAPTER VII.  OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY      Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace and paused  not once for breath until he reached the workhousegate. Having rested  here for a minute or so to collect a good burst of sobs and an  imposing show of tears and terror he knocked loudly at the wicket and  presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it that  even he who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of  times started back in astonishment.    Why whats the matter with the boy said the old pauper.    Mr. Bumble Mr. Bumble cried Noah with wellaffected dismay and in  tones so loud and agitated that they not only caught the ear of Mr.  Bumble himself who happened to be hard by but alarmed him so much  that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat—which is a very  curious and remarkable circumstance as showing that even a beadle  acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse may be afflicted with a  momentary visitation of loss of selfpossession and forgetfulness of  personal dignity.    Oh Mr. Bumble sir said Noah Oliver sir—Oliver has—    What What interposed Mr. Bumble with a gleam of pleasure in his  metallic eyes. Not run away he hasnt run away has he Noah    No sir no. Not run away sir but hes turned wicious replied  Noah. He tried to murder me sir and then he tried to murder  Charlotte and then missis. Oh what dreadful pain it is Such agony  please sir And here Noah writhed and twisted his body into an  extensive variety of eellike positions thereby giving Mr. Bumble to  understand that from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist  he had sustained severe internal injury and damage from which he was  at that moment suffering the acutest torture.    When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed  Mr. Bumble he imparted additional effect thereunto by bewailing his  dreadful wounds ten times louder than before and when he observed a  gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard he was more tragic in  his lamentations than ever rightly conceiving it highly expedient to  attract the notice and rouse the indignation of the gentleman  aforesaid.    The gentlemans notice was very soon attracted for he had not walked  three paces when he turned angrily round and inquired what that young  cur was howling for and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with  something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so  designated an involuntary process    Its a poor boy from the freeschool sir replied Mr. Bumble who  has been nearly murdered—all but murdered sir—by young Twist.    By Jove exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat stopping  short. I knew it I felt a strange presentiment from the very first  that that audacious young savage would come to be hung    He has likewise attempted sir to murder the female servant said  Mr. Bumble with a face of ashy paleness.    And his missis interposed Mr. Claypole.    And his master too I think you said Noah added Mr. Bumble.    No hes out or he would have murdered him replied Noah. He said  he wanted to.    Ah Said he wanted to did he my boy inquired the gentleman in the  white waistcoat.    Yes sir replied Noah. And please sir missis wants to know  whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there directly and flog  him—cause masters out.    Certainly my boy certainly said the gentleman in the white  waistcoat smiling benignly and patting Noahs head which was about  three inches higher than his own. Youre a good boy—a very good boy.  Heres a penny for you. Bumble just step up to Sowerberrys with your  cane and see whats best to be done. Dont spare him Bumble.    No I will not sir replied the beadle. And the cocked hat and cane  having been by this time adjusted to their owners satisfaction Mr.  Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the  undertakers shop.    Here the position of affairs had not at all improved. Sowerberry had  not yet returned and Oliver continued to kick with undiminished  vigour at the cellardoor. The accounts of his ferocity as related by  Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte were of so startling a nature that Mr.  Bumble judged it prudent to parley before opening the door. With this  view he gave a kick at the outside by way of prelude and then  applying his mouth to the keyhole said in a deep and impressive tone    Oliver    Come you let me out replied Oliver from the inside.    Do you know this here voice Oliver said Mr. Bumble.    Yes replied Oliver.    Aint you afraid of it sir Aint you atrembling while I speak  sir said Mr. Bumble.    No replied Oliver boldly.    An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit and was  in the habit of receiving staggered Mr. Bumble not a little. He  stepped back from the keyhole drew himself up to his full height and  looked from one to another of the three bystanders in mute  astonishment.    Oh you know Mr. Bumble he must be mad said Mrs. Sowerberry.    No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.    Its not Madness maam replied Mr. Bumble after a few moments of  deep meditation. Its Meat.    What exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.    Meat maam meat replied Bumble with stern emphasis. Youve  overfed him maam. Youve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him  maam unbecoming a person of his condition as the board Mrs.  Sowerberry who are practical philosophers will tell you. What have  paupers to do with soul or spirit Its quite enough that we let em  have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel maam this would  never have happened.    Dear dear ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry piously raising her eyes to  the kitchen ceiling this comes of being liberal    The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver had consisted of a profuse  bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else  would eat so there was a great deal of meekness and selfdevotion in  her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumbles heavy accusation. Of  which to do her justice she was wholly innocent in thought word or  deed.    Ah said Mr. Bumble when the lady brought her eyes down to earth  again the only thing that can be done now that I know of is to  leave him in the cellar for a day or so till hes a little starved  down and then to take him out and keep him on gruel all through the  apprenticeship. He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures Mrs.  Sowerberry Both the nurse and doctor said that that mother of his  made her way here against difficulties and pain that would have killed  any welldisposed woman weeks before.    At this point of Mr. Bumbles discourse Oliver just hearing enough to  know that some allusion was being made to his mother recommenced  kicking with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.  Sowerberry returned at this juncture. Olivers offence having been  explained to him with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best  calculated to rouse his ire he unlocked the cellardoor in a  twinkling and dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar.    Olivers clothes had been torn in the beating he had received his face  was bruised and scratched and his hair scattered over his forehead.  The angry flush had not disappeared however and when he was pulled  out of his prison he scowled boldly on Noah and looked quite  undismayed.    Now you are a nice young fellow aint you said Sowerberry giving  Oliver a shake and a box on the ear.    He called my mother names replied Oliver.    Well and what if he did you little ungrateful wretch said Mrs.  Sowerberry. She deserved what he said and worse.    She didnt said Oliver.    She did said Mrs. Sowerberry.    Its a lie said Oliver.    Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.    This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. If he had  hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely it must be  quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been  according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established a  brute an unnatural husband an insulting creature a base imitation of  a man and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital  within the limits of this chapter. To do him justice he was as far as  his power went—it was not very extensive—kindly disposed towards the  boy perhaps because it was his interest to be so perhaps because  his wife disliked him. The flood of tears however left him no  resource so he at once gave him a drubbing which satisfied even Mrs.  Sowerberry herself and rendered Mr. Bumbles subsequent application of  the parochial cane rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day he was  shut up in the back kitchen in company with a pump and a slice of  bread and at night Mrs. Sowerberry after making various remarks  outside the door by no means complimentary to the memory of his  mother looked into the room and amidst the jeers and pointings of  Noah and Charlotte ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.    It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the  gloomy workshop of the undertaker that Oliver gave way to the feelings  which the days treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a  mere child. He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt he  had borne the lash without a cry for he felt that pride swelling in  his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last though they  had roasted him alive. But now when there were none to see or hear  him he fell upon his knees on the floor and hiding his face in his  hands wept such tears as God send for the credit of our nature few  so young may ever have cause to pour out before him    For a long time Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The  candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having  gazed cautiously round him and listened intently he gently undid the  fastenings of the door and looked abroad.    It was a cold dark night. The stars seemed to the boys eyes farther  from the earth than he had ever seen them before there was no wind  and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground looked  sepulchral and deathlike from being so still. He softly reclosed the  door. Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie  up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had sat  himself down upon a bench to wait for morning.    With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the  shutters Oliver arose and again unbarred the door. One timid look  around—one moments pause of hesitation—he had closed it behind him  and was in the open street.    He looked to the right and to the left uncertain whither to fly.    He remembered to have seen the waggons as they went out toiling up  the hill. He took the same route and arriving at a footpath across the  fields which he knew after some distance led out again into the  road struck into it and walked quickly on.    Along this same footpath Oliver wellremembered he had trotted beside  Mr. Bumble when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.  His way lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly  when he bethought himself of this and he half resolved to turn back.  He had come a long way though and should lose a great deal of time by  doing so. Besides it was so early that there was very little fear of  his being seen so he walked on.    He reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring  at that early hour. Oliver stopped and peeped into the garden. A child  was weeding one of the little beds as he stopped he raised his pale  face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions. Oliver  felt glad to see him before he went for though younger than himself  he had been his little friend and playmate. They had been beaten and  starved and shut up together many and many a time.    Hush Dick said Oliver as the boy ran to the gate and thrust his  thin arm between the rails to greet him. Is any one up    Nobody but me replied the child.    You musnt say you saw me Dick said Oliver. I am running away.  They beat and illuse me Dick and I am going to seek my fortune some  long way off. I dont know where. How pale you are    I heard the doctor tell them I was dying replied the child with a  faint smile. I am very glad to see you dear but dont stop dont  stop    Yes yes I will to say goodbye to you replied Oliver. I shall  see you again Dick. I know I shall You will be well and happy    I hope so replied the child. After I am dead but not before. I  know the doctor must be right Oliver because I dream so much of  Heaven and Angels and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.  Kiss me said the child climbing up the low gate and flinging his  little arms round Olivers neck. Goodbye dear God bless you    The blessing was from a young childs lips but it was the first that  Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head and through the struggles  and sufferings and troubles and changes of his after life he never  once forgot it.           CHAPTER VIII.  OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF  YOUNG GENTLEMAN      Oliver reached the stile at which the bypath terminated and once more  gained the highroad. It was eight oclock now. Though he was nearly  five miles away from the town he ran and hid behind the hedges by  turns till noon fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken. Then  he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone and began to think  for the first time where he had better go and try to live.    The stone by which he was seated bore in large characters an  intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The  name awakened a new train of ideas in the boys mind.    London—that great place—nobody—not even Mr. Bumble—could ever find  him there He had often heard the old men in the workhouse too say  that no lad of spirit need want in London and that there were ways of  living in that vast city which those who had been bred up in country  parts had no idea of. It was the very place for a homeless boy who  must die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these things  passed through his thoughts he jumped upon his feet and again walked  forward.    He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four  miles more before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could  hope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced  itself upon him he slackened his pace a little and meditated upon his  means of getting there. He had a crust of bread a coarse shirt and  two pairs of stockings in his bundle. He had a penny too—a gift of  Sowerberrys after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more  than ordinarily well—in his pocket. A clean shirt thought Oliver  is a very comfortable thing and so are two pairs of darned stockings  and so is a penny but they are small helps to a sixtyfive miles walk  in winter time. But Olivers thoughts like those of most other  people although they were extremely ready and active to point out his  difficulties were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of  surmounting them so after a good deal of thinking to no particular  purpose he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder and  trudged on.    Oliver walked twenty miles that day and all that time tasted nothing  but the crust of dry bread and a few draughts of water which he  begged at the cottagedoors by the roadside. When the night came he  turned into a meadow and creeping close under a hayrick determined  to lie there till morning. He felt frightened at first for the wind  moaned dismally over the empty fields and he was cold and hungry and  more alone than he had ever felt before. Being very tired with his  walk however he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.    He felt cold and stiff when he got up next morning and so hungry that  he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf in the very  first village through which he passed. He had walked no more than  twelve miles when night closed in again. His feet were sore and his  legs so weak that they trembled beneath him. Another night passed in  the bleak damp air made him worse when he set forward on his journey  next morning he could hardly crawl along.    He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stagecoach came up and  then begged of the outside passengers but there were very few who took  any notice of him and even those told him to wait till they got to the  top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a  halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way  but was unable to do it by reason of his fatigue and sore feet. When  the outsides saw this they put their halfpence back into their pockets  again declaring that he was an idle young dog and didnt deserve  anything and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust  behind.    In some villages large painted boards were fixed up warning all  persons who begged within the district that they would be sent to  jail. This frightened Oliver very much and made him glad to get out of  those villages with all possible expedition. In others he would stand  about the innyards and look mournfully at every one who passed a  proceeding which generally terminated in the landladys ordering one of  the postboys who were lounging about to drive that strange boy out of  the place for she was sure he had come to steal something. If he  begged at a farmers house ten to one but they threatened to set the  dog on him and when he showed his nose in a shop they talked about  the beadle—which brought Olivers heart into his mouth—very often the  only thing he had there for many hours together.    In fact if it had not been for a goodhearted turnpikeman and a  benevolent old lady Olivers troubles would have been shortened by the  very same process which had put an end to his mothers in other words  he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the kings highway. But  the turnpikeman gave him a meal of bread and cheese and the old lady  who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part  of the earth took pity upon the poor orphan and gave him what little  she could afford—and more—with such kind and gentle words and such  tears of sympathy and compassion that they sank deeper into Olivers  soul than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.    Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place Oliver  limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The windowshutters were  closed the street was empty not a soul had awakened to the business  of the day. The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty but the  light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation  as he sat with bleeding feet and covered with dust upon a doorstep.    By degrees the shutters were opened the windowblinds were drawn up  and people began passing to and fro. Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver  for a moment or two or turned round to stare at him as they hurried  by but none relieved him or troubled themselves to inquire how he  came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.    He had been crouching on the step for some time wondering at the great  number of publichouses every other house in Barnet was a tavern  large or small gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed  through and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do with  ease in a few hours what it had taken him a whole week of courage and  determination beyond his years to accomplish when he was roused by  observing that a boy who had passed him carelessly some minutes  before had returned and was now surveying him most earnestly from the  opposite side of the way. He took little heed of this at first but the  boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long that  Oliver raised his head and returned his steady look. Upon this the  boy crossed over and walking close up to Oliver said    Hullo my covey Whats the row    The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer was about his  own age but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even  seen. He was a snubnosed flatbrowed commonfaced boy enough and as  dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see but he had about him all the  airs and manners of a man. He was short of his age with rather  bowlegs and little sharp ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of  his head so lightly that it threatened to fall off every moment—and  would have done so very often if the wearer had not had a knack of  every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch which brought it  back to its old place again. He wore a mans coat which reached nearly  to his heels. He had turned the cuffs back halfway up his arm to get  his hands out of the sleeves apparently with the ultimate view of  thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers for there he  kept them. He was altogether as roystering and swaggering a young  gentleman as ever stood four feet six or something less in the  bluchers.    Hullo my covey Whats the row said this strange young gentleman to  Oliver.    I am very hungry and tired replied Oliver the tears standing in his  eyes as he spoke. I have walked a long way. I have been walking these  seven days.    Walking for sivin days said the young gentleman. Oh I see. Beaks  order eh But he added noticing Olivers look of surprise I  suppose you dont know what a beak is my flash companion.    Oliver mildly replied that he had always heard a birds mouth  described by the term in question.    My eyes how green exclaimed the young gentleman. Why a beaks a  madgstrate and when you walk by a beaks order its not straight  forerd but always agoing up and niver a coming down agin. Was you  never on the mill    What mill inquired Oliver.    What mill Why the mill—the mill as takes up so little room that  itll work inside a Stone Jug and always goes better when the winds  low with people than when its high acos then they cant get workmen.  But come said the young gentleman you want grub and you shall have  it. Im at lowwatermark myself—only one bob and a magpie but as far  as it goes Ill fork out and stump. Up with you on your pins. There  Now then Morrice    Assisting Oliver to rise the young gentleman took him to an adjacent  chandlers shop where he purchased a sufficiency of readydressed ham  and a halfquartern loaf or as he himself expressed it a fourpenny  bran the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust by the  ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a  portion of the crumb and stuffing it therein. Taking the bread under  his arm the young gentlman turned into a small publichouse and led  the way to a taproom in the rear of the premises. Here a pot of beer  was brought in by direction of the mysterious youth and Oliver  falling to at his new friends bidding made a long and hearty meal  during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time  with great attention.    Going to London said the strange boy when Oliver had at length  concluded.    Yes.    Got any lodgings    No.    Money    No.    The strange boy whistled and put his arms into his pockets as far as  the big coatsleeves would let them go.    Do you live in London inquired Oliver.    Yes. I do when Im at home replied the boy. I suppose you want  some place to sleep in tonight dont you    I do indeed answered Oliver. I have not slept under a roof since I  left the country.    Dont fret your eyelids on that score said the young gentleman.  Ive got to be in London tonight and I know a spectable old  gentleman as lives there wotll give you lodgings for nothink and  never ask for the change—that is if any genelman he knows interduces  you. And dont he know me Oh no Not in the least By no means.  Certainly not    The young gentleman smiled as if to intimate that the latter fragments  of discourse were playfully ironical and finished the beer as he did  so.    This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted  especially as it was immediately followed up by the assurance that the  old gentleman referred to would doubtless provide Oliver with a  comfortable place without loss of time. This led to a more friendly  and confidential dialogue from which Oliver discovered that his  friends name was Jack Dawkins and that he was a peculiar pet and  protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.    Mr. Dawkins appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the  comforts which his patrons interest obtained for those whom he took  under his protection but as he had a rather flightly and dissolute  mode of conversing and furthermore avowed that among his intimate  friends he was better known by the sobriquet of The Artful Dodger  Oliver concluded that being of a dissipated and careless turn the  moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon  him. Under this impression he secretly resolved to cultivate the good  opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible and if he found  the Dodger incorrigible as he more than half suspected he should to  decline the honour of his farther acquaintance.    As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall it  was nearly eleven oclock when they reached the turnpike at Islington.  They crossed from the Angel into St. Johns Road struck down the small  street which terminates at Sadlers Wells Theatre through Exmouth  Street and Coppice Row down the little court by the side of the  workhouse across the classic ground which once bore the name of  HockleyintheHole thence into Little Saffron Hill and so into  Saffron Hill the Great along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace  directing Oliver to follow close at his heels.    Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of  his leader he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either  side of the way as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place  he had never seen. The street was very narrow and muddy and the air  was impregnated with filthy odours.    There were a good many small shops but the only stock in trade  appeared to be heaps of children who even at that time of night were  crawling in and out at the doors or screaming from the inside. The  sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the  place were the publichouses and in them the lowest orders of Irish  were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards which here  and there diverged from the main street disclosed little knots of  houses where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth  and from several of the doorways great illlooking fellows were  cautiously emerging bound to all appearance on no very welldisposed  or harmless errands.    Oliver was just considering whether he hadnt better run away when  they reached the bottom of the hill. His conductor catching him by the  arm pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane and drawing him  into the passage closed it behind them.    Now then cried a voice from below in reply to a whistle from the  Dodger.    Plummy and slam was the reply.    This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right for the  light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the  passage and a mans face peeped out from where a balustrade of the  old kitchen staircase had been broken away.    Theres two on you said the man thrusting the candle farther out  and shielding his eyes with his hand. Whos the tother one    A new pal replied Jack Dawkins pulling Oliver forward.    Where did he come from    Greenland. Is Fagin upstairs    Yes hes a sortin the wipes. Up with you The candle was drawn  back and the face disappeared.    Oliver groping his way with one hand and having the other firmly  grasped by his companion ascended with much difficulty the dark and  broken stairs which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition  that showed he was well acquainted with them.    He threw open the door of a backroom and drew Oliver in after him.    The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and  dirt. There was a deal table before the fire upon which were a candle  stuck in a gingerbeer bottle two or three pewter pots a loaf and  butter and a plate. In a fryingpan which was on the fire and which  was secured to the mantelshelf by a string some sausages were cooking  and standing over them with a toastingfork in his hand was a very  old shrivelled Jew whose villainouslooking and repulsive face was  obscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He was dressed in a greasy  flannel gown with his throat bare and seemed to be dividing his  attention between the fryingpan and the clotheshorse over which a  great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging. Several rough beds  made of old sacks were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round  the table were four or five boys none older than the Dodger smoking  long clay pipes and drinking spirits with the air of middleaged men.  These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to  the Jew and then turned round and grinned at Oliver. So did the Jew  himself toastingfork in hand.    This is him Fagin said Jack Dawkins my friend Oliver Twist.    The Jew grinned and making a low obeisance to Oliver took him by the  hand and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.  Upon this the young gentleman with the pipes came round him and shook  both his hands very hard—especially the one in which he held his little  bundle. One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for  him and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets in  order that as he was very tired he might not have the trouble of  emptying them himself when he went to bed. These civilities would  probably be extended much farther but for a liberal exercise of the  Jews toastingfork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate  youths who offered them.    We are very glad to see you Oliver very said the Jew. Dodger  take off the sausages and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. Ah  youre astaring at the pockethandkerchiefs eh my dear. There are a  good many of em aint there Weve just looked em out ready for the  wash thats all Oliver thats all. Ha ha ha    The latter part of this speech was hailed by a boisterous shout from  all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of  which they went to supper.    Oliver ate his share and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot  ginandwater telling him he must drink it off directly because  another gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he was desired.  Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the  sacks and then he sunk into a deep sleep.           CHAPTER IX.  CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN  AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS      It was late next morning when Oliver awoke from a sound long sleep.  There was no other person in the room but the old Jew who was boiling  some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast and whistling softly to  himself as he stirred it round and round with an iron spoon. He would  stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below  and when he had satisfied himself he would go on whistling and  stirring again as before.    Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep he was not thoroughly  awake. There is a drowsy state between sleeping and waking when you  dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open and yourself half  conscious of everything that is passing around you than you would in  five nights with your eyes fast closed and your senses wrapt in  perfect unconsciousness. At such time a mortal knows just enough of  what his mind is doing to form some glimmering conception of its  mighty powers its bounding from earth and spurning time and space  when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.    Oliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his  halfclosed eyes heard his low whistling and recognised the sound of  the spoon grating against the saucepans sides and yet the selfsame  senses were mentally engaged at the same time in busy action with  almost everybody he had ever known.    When the coffee was done the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.  Standing then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes as if he  did not well know how to employ himself he turned round and looked at  Oliver and called him by his name. He did not answer and was to all  appearances asleep.    After satisfying himself upon this head the Jew stepped gently to the  door which he fastened. He then drew forth as it seemed to Oliver  from some trap in the floor a small box which he placed carefully on  the table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid and looked in.  Dragging an old chair to the table he sat down and took from it a  magnificent gold watch sparkling with jewels.    Aha said the Jew shrugging up his shoulders and distorting every  feature with a hideous grin. Clever dogs Clever dogs Staunch to the  last Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old  Fagin And why should they It wouldnt have loosened the knot or kept  the drop up a minute longer. No no no Fine fellows Fine fellows    With these and other muttered reflections of the like nature the Jew  once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a  dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box and surveyed  with equal pleasure besides rings brooches bracelets and other  articles of jewellery of such magnificent materials and costly  workmanship that Oliver had no idea even of their names.    Having replaced these trinkets the Jew took out another so small that  it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute  inscription on it for the Jew laid it flat upon the table and shading  it with his hand pored over it long and earnestly. At length he put  it down as if despairing of success and leaning back in his chair  muttered    What a fine thing capital punishment is Dead men never repent dead  men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah its a fine thing for the  trade Five of em strung up in a row and none left to play booty or  turn whitelivered    As the Jew uttered these words his bright dark eyes which had been  staring vacantly before him fell on Olivers face the boys eyes were  fixed on his in mute curiousity and although the recognition was only  for an instant—for the briefest space of time that can possibly be  conceived—it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.    He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash and laying his hand on  a bread knife which was on the table started furiously up. He trembled  very much though for even in his terror Oliver could see that the  knife quivered in the air.    Whats that said the Jew. What do you watch me for Why are you  awake What have you seen Speak out boy Quick—quick for your life.    I wasnt able to sleep any longer sir replied Oliver meekly. I am  very sorry if I have disturbed you sir.    You were not awake an hour ago said the Jew scowling fiercely on  the boy.    No No indeed replied Oliver.    Are you sure cried the Jew with a still fiercer look than before  and a threatening attitude.    Upon my word I was not sir replied Oliver earnestly. I was not  indeed sir.    Tush tush my dear said the Jew abruptly resuming his old manner  and playing with the knife a little before he laid it down as if to  induce the belief that he had caught it up in mere sport. Of course I  know that my dear. I only tried to frighten you. Youre a brave boy.  Ha ha youre a brave boy Oliver. The Jew rubbed his hands with a  chuckle but glanced uneasily at the box notwithstanding.    Did you see any of these pretty things my dear said the Jew laying  his hand upon it after a short pause.    Yes sir replied Oliver.    Ah said the Jew turning rather pale. They—theyre mine Oliver my  little property. All I have to live upon in my old age. The folks call  me a miser my dear. Only a miser thats all.    Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in  such a dirty place with so many watches but thinking that perhaps  his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys cost him a good deal of  money he only cast a deferential look at the Jew and asked if he  might get up.    Certainly my dear certainly replied the old gentleman. Stay.  Theres a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here  and Ill give you a basin to wash in my dear.    Oliver got up walked across the room and stooped for an instant to  raise the pitcher. When he turned his head the box was gone.    He had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by emptying  the basin out of the window agreeably to the Jews directions when  the Dodger returned accompanied by a very sprightly young friend whom  Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night and who was now formally  introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down to breakfast on  the coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought  home in the crown of his hat.    Well said the Jew glancing slyly at Oliver and addressing himself  to the Dodger I hope youve been at work this morning my dears    Hard replied the Dodger.    As nails added Charley Bates.    Good boys good boys said the Jew. What have you got Dodger    A couple of pocketbooks replied that young gentlman.    Lined inquired the Jew with eagerness.    Pretty well replied the Dodger producing two pocketbooks one  green and the other red.    Not so heavy as they might be said the Jew after looking at the  insides carefully but very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman  aint he Oliver    Very indeed sir said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed  uproariously very much to the amazement of Oliver who saw nothing to  laugh at in anything that had passed.    And what have you got my dear said Fagin to Charley Bates.    Wipes replied Master Bates at the same time producing four  pockethandkerchiefs.    Well said the Jew inspecting them closely theyre very good ones  very. You havent marked them well though Charley so the marks shall  be picked out with a needle and well teach Oliver how to do it. Shall  us Oliver eh Ha ha ha    If you please sir said Oliver.    Youd like to be able to make pockethandkerchiefs as easy as Charley  Bates wouldnt you my dear said the Jew.    Very much indeed if youll teach me sir replied Oliver.    Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply that  he burst into another laugh which laugh meeting the coffee he was  drinking and carrying it down some wrong channel very nearly  terminated in his premature suffocation.    He is so jolly green said Charley when he recovered as an apology  to the company for his unpolite behaviour.    The Dodger said nothing but he smoothed Olivers hair over his eyes  and said hed know better by and by upon which the old gentleman  observing Olivers colour mounting changed the subject by asking  whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning  This made him wonder more and more for it was plain from the replies  of the two boys that they had both been there and Oliver naturally  wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very  industrious.    When the breakfast was cleared away the merry old gentlman and the two  boys played at a very curious and uncommon game which was performed in  this way. The merry old gentleman placing a snuffbox in one pocket of  his trousers a notecase in the other and a watch in his waistcoat  pocket with a guardchain round his neck and sticking a mock diamond  pin in his shirt buttoned his coat tight round him and putting his  spectaclecase and handkerchief in his pockets trotted up and down the  room with a stick in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen  walk about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the  fireplace and sometimes at the door making believe that he was  staring with all his might into shopwindows. At such times he would  look constantly round him for fear of thieves and would keep slapping  all his pockets in turn to see that he hadnt lost anything in such a  very funny and natural manner that Oliver laughed till the tears ran  down his face. All this time the two boys followed him closely about  getting out of his sight so nimbly every time he turned round that  it was impossible to follow their motions. At last the Dodger trod  upon his toes or ran upon his boot accidently while Charley Bates  stumbled up against him behind and in that one moment they took from  him with the most extraordinary rapidity snuffbox notecase  watchguard chain shirtpin pockethandkerchief even the  spectaclecase. If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his  pockets he cried out where it was and then the game began all over  again.    When this game had been played a great many times a couple of young  ladies called to see the young gentleman one of whom was named Bet  and the other Nancy. They wore a good deal of hair not very neatly  turned up behind and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings.  They were not exactly pretty perhaps but they had a great deal of  colour in their faces and looked quite stout and hearty. Being  remarkably free and agreeable in their manners Oliver thought them  very nice girls indeed. As there is no doubt they were.    The visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced in consequence  of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside and  the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length  Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof.  This it occurred to Oliver must be French for going out for directly  afterwards the Dodger and Charley and the two young ladies went  away together having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with  money to spend.    There my dear said Fagin. Thats a pleasant life isnt it They  have gone out for the day.    Have they done work sir inquired Oliver.    Yes said the Jew that is unless they should unexpectedly come  across any when they are out and they wont neglect it if they do  my dear depend upon it. Make em your models my dear. Make em your  models tapping the fireshovel on the hearth to add force to his  words do everything they bid you and take their advice in all  matters—especially the Dodgers my dear. Hell be a great man himself  and will make you one too if you take pattern by him.—Is my  handkerchief hanging out of my pocket my dear said the Jew stopping  short.    Yes sir said Oliver.    See if you can take it out without my feeling it as you saw them do  when we were at play this morning.    Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand as he had seen  the Dodger hold it and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with  the other.    Is it gone cried the Jew.    Here it is sir said Oliver showing it in his hand.    Youre a clever boy my dear said the playful old gentleman patting  Oliver on the head approvingly. I never saw a sharper lad. Heres a  shilling for you. If you go on in this way youll be the greatest man  of the time. And now come here and Ill show you how to take the marks  out of the handkerchiefs.    Oliver wondered what picking the old gentlemans pocket in play had to  do with his chances of being a great man. But thinking that the Jew  being so much his senior must know best he followed him quietly to  the table and was soon deeply involved in his new study.           CHAPTER X.  OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW  ASSOCIATES AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT  BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER IN THIS HISTORY      For many days Oliver remained in the Jews room picking the marks out  of the pockethandkerchief of which a great number were brought  home and sometimes taking part in the game already described which  the two boys and the Jew played regularly every morning. At length  he began to languish for fresh air and took many occasions of  earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work  with his two companions.    Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed by what  he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentlemans character.  Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night emptyhanded  he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy  habits and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life by  sending them supperless to bed. On one occasion indeed he even went  so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs but this was  carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.    At length one morning Oliver obtained the permission he had so  eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon for two  or three days and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these  were reasons for the old gentlemans giving his assent but whether  they were or no he told Oliver he might go and placed him under the  joint guardianship of Charley Bates and his friend the Dodger.    The three boys sallied out the Dodger with his coatsleeves tucked up  and his hat cocked as usual Master Bates sauntering along with his  hands in his pockets and Oliver between them wondering where they  were going and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in  first.    The pace at which they went was such a very lazy illlooking saunter  that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive  the old gentleman by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a  vicious propensity too of pulling the caps from the heads of small  boys and tossing them down areas while Charley Bates exhibited some  very loose notions concerning the rights of property by pilfering  divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides and  thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious that  they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.  These things looked so bad that Oliver was on the point of declaring  his intention of seeking his way back in the best way he could when  his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel by a very  mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.    They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open  square in Clerkenwell which is yet called by some strange perversion  of terms The Green when the Dodger made a sudden stop and laying  his finger on his lip drew his companions back again with the  greatest caution and circumspection.    Whats the matter demanded Oliver.    Hush replied the Dodger. Do you see that old cove at the  bookstall    The old gentleman over the way said Oliver. Yes I see him.    Hell do said the Dodger.    A prime plant observed Master Charley Bates.    Oliver looked from one to the other with the greatest surprise but he  was not permitted to make any inquiries for the two boys walked  stealthily across the road and slunk close behind the old gentleman  towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces  after them and not knowing whether to advance or retire stood  looking on in silent amazement.    The old gentleman was a very respectablelooking personage with a  powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottlegreen  coat with a black velvet collar wore white trousers and carried a  smart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall  and there he stood reading away as hard as if he were in his  elbowchair in his own study. It is very possible that he fancied  himself there indeed for it was plain from his abstraction that he  saw not the bookstall nor the street nor the boys nor in short  anything but the book itself which he was reading straight through  turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page beginning at  the top line of the next one and going regularly on with the greatest  interest and eagerness.    What was Olivers horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off looking  on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go to see the  Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentlemans pocket and draw from  thence a handkerchief To see him hand the same to Charley Bates and  finally to behold them both running away round the corner at full  speed    In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs and the watches  and the jewels and the Jew rushed upon the boys mind.    He stood for a moment with the blood so tingling through all his  veins from terror that he felt as if he were in a burning fire then  confused and frightened he took to his heels and not knowing what he  did made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.    This was all done in a minutes space. In the very instant when Oliver  began to run the old gentleman putting his hand to his pocket and  missing his handkerchief turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding  away at such a rapid pace he very naturally concluded him to be the  depredator and shouting Stop thief with all his might made off  after him book in hand.    But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the  hueandcry. The Dodger and Master Bates unwilling to attract public  attention by running down the open street had merely retired into the  very first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry and  saw Oliver running than guessing exactly how the matter stood they  issued forth with great promptitude and shouting Stop thief too  joined in the pursuit like good citizens.    Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers he was not  theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that  selfpreservation is the first law of nature. If he had been perhaps  he would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared however it  alarmed him the more so away he went like the wind with the old  gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.    Stop thief Stop thief There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman  leaves his counter and the carman his waggon the butcher throws down  his tray the baker his basket the milkman his pail the errandboy  his parcels the schoolboy his marbles the paviour his pickaxe the  child his battledore. Away they run pellmell helterskelter  slapdash tearing yelling screaming knocking down the passengers as  they turn the corners rousing up the dogs and astonishing the fowls  and streets squares and courts reecho with the sound.    Stop thief Stop thief The cry is taken up by a hundred voices and  the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly splashing through  the mud and rattling along the pavements up go the windows out run  the people onward bear the mob a whole audience desert Punch in the  very thickest of the plot and joining the rushing throng swell the  shout and lend fresh vigour to the cry Stop thief Stop thief    Stop thief Stop thief There is a passion FOR hunting something  deeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched breathless child  panting with exhaustion terror in his looks agony in his eyes large  drops of perspiration streaming down his face strains every nerve to  make head upon his pursuers and as they follow on his track and gain  upon him every instant they hail his decreasing strength with joy.  Stop thief Ay stop him for Gods sake were it only in mercy    Stopped at last A clever blow. He is down upon the pavement and the  crowd eagerly gather round him each new comer jostling and struggling  with the others to catch a glimpse. Stand aside Give him a little  air Nonsense he dont deserve it. Wheres the gentleman Here  his is coming down the street. Make room there for the gentleman  Is this the boy sir Yes.    Oliver lay covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth  looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him when  the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by  the foremost of the pursuers.    Yes said the gentleman I am afraid it is the boy.    Afraid murmured the crowd. Thats a good un    Poor fellow said the gentleman he has hurt himself.    I did that sir said a great lubberly fellow stepping forward  and preciously I cut my knuckle agin his mouth. I stopped him sir.    The fellow touched his hat with a grin expecting something for his  pains but the old gentleman eyeing him with an expression of  dislike look anxiously round as if he contemplated running away  himself which it is very possible he might have attempted to do and  thus have afforded another chase had not a police officer who is  generally the last person to arrive in such cases at that moment made  his way through the crowd and seized Oliver by the collar.    Come get up said the man roughly.    It wasnt me indeed sir. Indeed indeed it was two other boys said  Oliver clasping his hands passionately and looking round. They are  here somewhere.    Oh no they aint said the officer. He meant this to be ironical  but it was true besides for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off  down the first convenient court they came to.    Come get up    Dont hurt him said the old gentleman compassionately.    Oh no I wont hurt him replied the officer tearing his jacket half  off his back in proof thereof. Come I know you it wont do. Will  you stand upon your legs you young devil    Oliver who could hardly stand made a shift to raise himself on his  feet and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacketcollar at  a rapid pace. The gentleman walked on with them by the officers side  and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat got a little ahead  and stared back at Oliver from time to time. The boys shouted in  triumph and on they went.          '"
